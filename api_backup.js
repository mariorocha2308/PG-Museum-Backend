Born and raised in Columbus, Ohio, he played baseball and basketball as a youth, developing sufficient ability to letter in both at Ohio State University. According to some accounts, scouts for the Cincinnati Reds took notice of his shortstop talents. However, Bellows’s first love, art, ultimately intervened, and after his junior year he relocated to New York to study painting. In a remarkably short period he became the leading artist of his generation, a reputation fueled through boxing subjects such as <em>Stag at Sharkey’s.</em> In his later years he developed recreational passions for tennis and billiards, which he routinely played with friends. Bellows’s life was cut short at the age of 42, due to complications after his appendix ruptured.",

Founded by Tom “Sailor” Sharkey, an ex-fighter who had also served in the US Navy, the club attracted men seeking to watch or participate in matches. Because public boxing was illegal in New York at the time, a private event had to be arranged in order for a bout to take place. Participation was usually limited to members of a particular club, but whenever an outsider competed, he was given temporary membership and known as a “stag.” Although boxing had its share of detractors who considered it uncouth at best or barbaric at worst, its proponents—among them President Theodore Roosevelt—regarded it a healthy manifestation of manliness. Around the time Bellows painted <em>Stag at Sharkey’s, </em>boxing was moving from a predominantly working-class enterprise to one with greater genteel appeal. For some contemporaries, boxing was a powerful analogy for the notion that only the strongest and fittest would flourish in modern society.",

Medieval symbolism infuses the composition: death appears as a skeleton on horseback holding a scythe with which he cuts down the living, while a snake-a sign of temptation and evil-slithers in the foreground. An intense man, Ryder worked on the painting for several years and was deeply reluctant to part with it.",

          "biography": "Born into a wealthy farmer's family, Courbet began his training in 1831 at the Petit Séminaire in Ornans where, beginning in 1833, he studied under \"le père Baud,\" who had been a pupil of Gros (q.v.). He was befriended by poet Max Buchon, who would later write the first article on Courbet, claiming that he was the artist for the people. In 1837, hoping that Gustave would become a lawyer, his father sent him to the Collège Royal in Besançon. Despite his father's ambitions, Courbet began to study art at the academy there with Charles-Antoine Flageoulot (1774-1840), a former student of David (q.v.). By 1839 Courbet had moved to Paris to pursue a career in art. He refrained from entering the École des Beaux-Arts, studying instead briefly with Charles de Steuben (1788-1856) and preferring to learn how to paint by copying the works of the Old Masters in the museums. Courbet also wanted to work after life models and enrolled at the Académie Suisse. He began to submit paintings to the Salon, the majority of which were rejected. In 1846-47 Courbet traveled to the Netherlands where he studied the works of Rembrandt and Hals. The following year ten of his paintings were shown at the Salon, and together with his friends Baudelaire, Champfleury, and Buchon he became labeled a \"realist.\" Courbet's paintings shown at the 1851 Salon-Stonebreakers (1849, formerly Dresden Gemäldegalerie, destroyed during World War II), Peasants of Flagey (1850-55, Musée des Beaux-Arts, Besançon), and The Burial at Ornans (1849-50, Musée d'Orsay, Paris)-elicited criticism. Because Courbet represented the peasants as he saw them, without ennobling or idealizing them, his works met with disapproval. Moreover, these representations of peasants appeared at a time when the upper classes felt threatened by social unrest and by the instability of the republic. In 1855 Courbet financed an independent Pavillon du Réalisme near the Universal Exposition, where he showed his Painter's Studio (1854-55, Musée d'Orsay, Paris). He began to travel extensively, including visits to Gent, Brussels, Antwerp, Bruges, Cologne, Mainz, and Strasbourg. He returned to Germany in 1858, and while in Frankfurt, he began to paint the stag hunts he witnessed. The following year he visited the Normandy coast, painting seascapes, some of which became almost abstractions. Courbet turned to still lifes in 1862-63 when visiting the Saintonge area, yet he still continued to create landscapes and portraits. By 1870 he was offered the Legion of Honor but refused it because of his opposition to the imperial government. During the Paris Commune from March to May 1871, Courbet became an active member of the government. As chairman of the Commission for the Protection of the Artistic Monuments of Paris, he suggested the Vendôme Column be dismantled because it was an imperial symbol. The Commune decided instead to topple the column. When the Commune was defeated, Courbet was held responsible for this act of vandalism and was jailed for six months. In 1873 the government decided to rebuild the column at Courbet's expense. Unable to pay and fearful of being arrested, Courbet moved to Switzerland, where he spent the rest of his life in exile.",

While considering himself a radical innovator, Courbet nonetheless exhibited this portrait under the title Mme L... at the Paris Salon of 1863.",

The painting then appears again in 1916 in the second Matthews collection sale, this time at Anderson Galleries, with no mention of any ownership by Austin. It is possible that it failed to sell in 1914, and was simply put up for sale again in 1916. That both the 1914 and 1916 sales situate the painting in the collection of Matthews calls into question the supposed purchase by Austin, as does the fact that the 1916 sale notes that the painting was purchased by Matthews \"from Mrs. J.G.

Such a choice likely had nationalistic overtones, for Cole once proclaimed that autumn was \"one season where the American forest surpasses all the world in gorgeousness.\" Cole further underscored the New World character of his scene by depicting Native Americans in the right foreground foliage. At this time, the presence of Native Americans in the Adirondacks-as in most areas east of the Mississippi River-was rapidly diminishing due to forced resettlement and repression.",

          "biography": "Self-taught artist Henri Rousseau was born in Laval in 1844. He entered the military at the age of eighteen and served as a saxophone player in an infantry band. Most biographers discount his claim of traveling abroad during the Mexican campaign. In 1871 Rousseau left the military to join the customs service, where he spent fourteen years working on the outskirts of Paris as a minor inspector. After retiring with a small pension in 1885, he pursued the career of a painter and sought portrait commissions. From 1886 to 1910, he exhibited on a regular basis at the Salon des Indépendants, and after 1905, at the Salon d'Automne. Through these activities he became friendly with other artists, including Gauguin (q.v.), Pissarro (q.v.), Seurat (q.v), Paul Signac (1863-1935), and Redon (q.v.) who affectionately called him \"le douanier\" (customs officer). Rousseau's paintings were poorly received, and frequently ridiculed in the press, until he attracted a small group of admirers in the early years of this century. This group included Pablo Picasso, Maurice de Vlaminck, Robert Delaunay, Max Weber, and Ardengo Soffici, along with the writers Alfred Jarry, Max Jacob, André Salmon, and Guillaume Apollinaire. In 1908, a famous banquet honoring Rousseau was organized at Picasso's studio. Avant-garde artists admired Rousseau's direct, simple vision and his innate talent at clear, pictorial design. However, he aspired to paint in the academic manner of Gérôme (q.v.) and Bouguereau (q.v.). Rousseau reportedly told Picasso: \"We are the two greatest artists of this era-you in the Egyptian style, I in the modern style.\"1 Despite growing acclaim in his late years, Rousseau struggled for sales and was forced to supplement his meager income by giving private painting and violin lessons. He occasionally sold works through the dealers Ambroise Vollard and Wilhelm Uhde. In 1909 Rousseau was convicted of complicity in a bank fraud, but authorities suspended the sentence because of his age and apparent failure to comprehend his role in the crime. Rousseau died in Paris of pneumonia in 1910. In 1911 Uhde organized a retrospective at the Indépendants and published the first biography of Rousseau.",

He placed this imaginary scene of a tiger attacking a buffalo within a fantastic jungle environment in which botanical accuracy was of little importance (note the bananas growing upside down). Here, sharply outlined hothouse plants are enlarged to fearsome proportions. Rousseau was working on this painting while imprisoned for fraud in December 1907. Officials granted him an early release to finish it for exhibition at the Salon des Indépendants, where this major composition, one of the artist's largest and most important, appeared in March 1908. A self-taught artist and retired customs inspector, Rousseau was admired by Pablo Picasso and other avant-garde artists for his originality and the naïve purity of his vision.",

          "biography": "The son of a clergyman, Vincent van Gogh was sent to The Hague at the age of sixteen to become an apprentice at Goupil &amp; Co., an art dealer with whom his uncle was affiliated. In August 1872 van Gogh began his extensive correspondence with his younger brother Theo, who would join the Brussels branch of the firm the following year. Vincent was transferred to the London offices in 1873 and two years later to the Paris office, but he despised the art trade and was dismissed in 1876. He then taught briefly at a boarding school in Ramsgate and Isleworth, and, back in the Netherlands, worked in a bookshop in Dordrecht before moving to Amsterdam to study theology. In little more than a year he had left the university and entered missionary school, failing again. Still intent on entering the ministry, he moved to the Borinage in Belgium and became a lay evangelist to the miners. Van Gogh finally decided to become an artist in August 1880 and started copying works by Millet (q.v.), the painter of peasant life. With his brother's financial help, he briefly joined the Academy in Brussels. The following year he returned to The Hague, where he received some artistic training from his cousin by marriage, Anton Mauve (1838-1888). There van Gogh met Sien Hoornik, a pregnant prostitute with a five-year-old daughter, with whom he lived briefly. Unable to marry her because of his family's disapproval, he moved in November 1883 from The Hague to the province of Drenthe, a popular place for artists, where he painted and drew laborers and peasants. Feeling terribly lonely, he visited his parents in December 1884 in Nuenen, and it was there that he finally decided to become a painter of peasant life. Van Gogh completed The Potato Eaters (Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam) in April 1885 and sent it to his brother in Paris. On 25 November he moved to Antwerp, where he reveled in the work of Rubens and first came to know Japanese prints. Van Gogh traveled to Paris in March 1886 and lived with Theo. Under the influence of the impressionists, and works by Monticelli (q.v.), his palette changed to more intense and vibrant colors. He began to associate with Émile Bernard (1868-1941), Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864-1901), Degas (q.v.), Gauguin (q.v.), Pissarro (q.v.), and Seurat (q.v.) and started collecting some of their paintings as well as Japanese prints. He moved to Arles in February 1888. Apart from paintings, he also made some drawings because it was a cheaper medium. Theo encouraged him to submit to the Salon des Indépendants. In May Vincent rented a room in the Yellow House, even though he could hardly afford to do so, and continued to send his work to his brother. In June he became intrigued with the subject of the wheat harvest and painted The Sower (Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo). On 23 October 1888, Gauguin arrived in Arles, at a time when van Gogh was having trouble with his eyesight. Gauguin encouraged him to paint from memory, which resulted in Memory of the Garden in Etten (Hermitage, St. Petersburg). The artists, however, had many disagreements, and during a dramatic quarrel on 23 December van Gogh mutilated his ear. He was taken into a hospital in Arles, and Gauguin left for Paris. Van Gogh recovered rapidly and was dismissed on 7 January 1889. In February his neighbors objected to his presence in the Yellow House, and he had to return to the hospital. In April Theo married Johanna Gesina Bonger, who would eventually safeguard most of Vincent's oeuvre. Aware of his mental problems, at the end of April van Gogh checked himself into the asylum of Saint-Paul-de-Mausole in Saint-Rémy, where he was treated by Dr. Peyron. His condition was stable, and he was allowed to work in a makeshift studio. He worked in the garden (Irises, J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles) and painted the fields he could see from his window. Under supervision he painted in the countryside, rendering cypresses and olive trees. Starry Night (Museum of Modern Art, New York) also stems from this period. From July through September he suffered from a severe depression that prevented him from working. He resumed his work from October through December, painting well-known Provençal works and adapting prints after Delacroix (q.v.), Millet, and Rembrandt (1606-1669). In January 1890 he exhibited five works with Les XX in Brussels, selling one of them. After a visit to Arles at the end of February, he became ill again but continued to work. He finally left the asylum, and visited Theo in Paris on his way to Auvers, where he arrived on 20 May. He became close friends with Dr. Gachet and rented a room at the inn of the Ravoux family. He painted the village, portraits, and the surrounding wheat fields. On 27 July 1890, during an episode of depression, van Gogh shot himself in the chest and died two days later.",

While walking through the town that fall, he was impressed by the sight of men repairing a road beneath immense plane trees. Rushing to capture the yellowing leaves, he painted this composition on an unusual cloth with a pattern of small red diamonds, visible in the picture’s many unpainted areas. “In spite of the cold,” he wrote to his brother, “I have gone on working outside till now, and I think it is doing me good and the work too.” After painting this composition directly from nature, Van Gogh used it to produce a second version in the studio known as <em>The Road Menders at Saint-Rémy</em>. Painted on a traditional canvas covered by a ground layer, the second version is more restrained, the explosive yellows balanced by larger areas of cool color.",

          "biography": "Gauguin spent the first seven years of his life with his mother and great uncle in Peru. In 1855 his mother took him back to France where he attended boarding school. He joined the merchant marine when he was seventeen and began traveling around South America. When Gauguin's mother died in 1868, Gustave Arosa, an art collector and photographer, became his legal guardian. Arosa's collection included works by Corot (q.v.), Courbet (q.v.), Delacroix (q.v.), and the Barbizon painters, and it was he who would encourage Gauguin to start painting. In 1872 Arosa found a job for Gauguin at a brokerage firm, giving him financial security. The following year he married a Danish woman, Mette Gad. Gauguin had already started painting and sculpting in his spare time and first exhibited at the Salon in 1876 with a landscape.1 He was asked by Pissarro (q.v.) and Degas (q.v.) to participate in the fourth impressionist exhibition in 1879, where from then on he would exhibit regularly. Durand-Ruel began purchasing his paintings, and in turn Gauguin started to collect the works of his colleagues, such as Manet (q.v.) and Renoir (q.v.) and, in particular, Cézanne (q.v.) and Pissarro. He went to Pontoise in 1882, where he painted with Cézanne and Pissarro, who along with Degas continued to influence him at this period. In 1883 Gauguin decided to become a full-time artist. In 1884 he moved with his wife and children to Rouen and then to Copenhagen, but he failed to earn a comfortable living. He returned to Paris in 1886 and met ceramicist Ernest Chaplet (1835-1909), who introduced him to his métier. Gauguin distanced himself from impressionism and in 1888 worked in Pont-Aven with Émile Bernard (1868-1941), who had been experimenting with creating compositions using flat areas of color and dark outlines (cloissonism). Gauguin also studied Japanese prints and Indonesian art. The impact of these influences is evident in Gauguin's Vision after the Sermon: Jacob Wrestling with the Angel (1888, National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh), so far removed from his earlier impressionist style. Succumbing to van Gogh's (q.v.) many requests, Gauguin agreed to travel to Arles and paint with the artist; their characters, however, proved incompatible. Theo van Gogh, who worked for Boussod Valadon & Cie, would in the meantime sell Gauguin's work. For the next two years, Gauguin traveled often around Brittany. In search of a more pure and unspoiled culture, he auctioned off his paintings in 1891 in order to finance a journey to Tahiti. Upon his arrival, he was disappointed to find many expatriates and developed areas, yet he was still able to capture in his works an uncultivated spirit. He not only made paintings but also created bold woodcuts and sculptures and was an avid writer. Gauguin returned to France in 1893, where he was given a solo exhibition by Durand-Ruel that was not particularly successful. He decided to leave Europe again in 1895, moving to Tahiti and later to Hivaoa, a more remote island in the Marquesas. Because he abandoned naturalistic colors and used formal distortions in order to achieve expressive compositions, Gauguin's work became an inspiration for many subsequent artists. \r\n1.

          "biography": "Charles Sheeler American, 1883-1965\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia-born Charles Sheeler was a well-known precisionist painter and photographer. After studying at the School of Industrial Art in Philadelphia (1900-3), he spent the next three years as a student of painter William Merritt Chase at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts. Around 1910 he took up photography as a way to support himself.\r\n\tSheeler began as an architectural photographer, documenting buildings for Philadelphia architects, but was soon taking pictures of paintings and other works of art. He continued to paint (in 1913 a group of his works were exhibited in the famous Armory Show in New York) and to photograph, often using his photographs as the basis for paintings. In 1917 his photographs were included in a three-person show along with Paul Strand and Morton Schamberg at Marius de Zayas's Modern Gallery in New York.\r\n\tTwo years later Sheeler moved to New York and in 1920 collaborated with Paul Strand on the avant-garde film Manhatta (originally titled New York the Magnificent). In 1923 he began working as a staff photographer for Condé Nast publications. Four years later he received his most important commercial commission when Ford Motor Company hired him to photograph its River Rouge plant. A powerful series of images celebrating American industry resulted and were widely published. They also served as an inspiration for a number of his paintings.\r\n\tIn 1939 a small group of Sheeler's photographs were included in a retrospective of his work organized by the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Over the next decade he worked as staff photographer for the Metropolitan Museum of Art and focused primarily on painting in his own work, especially during the late 1940s and 1950s. In 1959, after suffering a stroke, Sheeler stopped painting and photographing; he died six years later from a second stroke. M.M.",

One of the first avant-garde American films, <em>Manhatta</em> celebrates the dynamic metropolis through a series of carefully composed shots of Lower Manhattan. As typical with Sheeler's work, the artist simplified forms and eliminated textures in <em>Church Street El</em> to concentrate on rhythmic interplay of shapes and color, and patterns of light and shadow.",

          "biography": "Claude Monet spent his youth in Le Havre in Normandy, where his father worked as a wholesale grocer. By the age of sixteen, he had exhibited some of his caricatures in an art supply store, leading to his acquaintance with Boudin (q.v.). It was Boudin who first encouraged him to paint out of doors. In 1859 Monet traveled to Paris, where he saw Boudin's salon debut and met Constant Troyon (1810-1865). A year later he joined the Académie Suisse, where he was introduced to Pissarro (q.v.), but his studies were interrupted in 1861 when he was drafted for a seven-year stint in the military. His family would pay for his release from military duties only if he gave up painting. Finding this unacceptable, Monet served for one year in Algeria before an early return to France to convalesce after a severe illness. In 1862 he met Jongkind (q.v.), another important influence on the young painter's development. Monet's father then allowed him to pursue his art career in Paris, where he entered the studio of the Swiss painter Charles Gleyre (1806-1874). He studied with Gleyre until 1864 and befriended Frédéric Bazille (1841-1870), Renoir (q.v.), and Sisley (q.v.), with whom he painted in the forest of Fontainebleau (Déjeuner sur l'herbe, 1865, two fragments in Musée d'Orsay, Paris). Monet first exhibited at the Salon of 1865 and would do so again in 1866, 1868, and 1880. In 1868 he shared a studio with Bazille and Renoir but was soon forced to leave Paris to escape his creditors. He took his mistress, Camille Doncieux, and their son, Jean, to Fécamp, then Étretat, and finally Saint-Michel. There Renoir provided hospitality, and the two also painted at the boating and bathing center of La Grenouillère on the Seine. In 1870 Monet married Camille and, to escape the Franco-Prussian War, left for London, where he remained for nine months and met Durand-Ruel, his first dealer. In the summer of 1871 he visited the Netherlands and then settled in Argenteuil, to the west of Paris. He converted a boat into a studio, as Daubigny (q.v.) had done before him, allowing him to explore different viewpoints for his landscapes. He assisted in the organization of the First Impressionist Exhibition in 1874, partly because Durand-Ruel's worsened business situation had prevented the dealer from buying his art. The following year he participated in the Hôtel Drouot sale with Morisot (q.v.), Renoir, and Sisley. In 1878 Monet and his wife moved to Vétheuil with the Hoschedés, who had previously commissioned some works. Camille died the following year, and, while Ernest Hoschedé spent most of his time in Paris trying to settle his precarious financial situation, Monet stayed behind with Ernest's wife, Alice. In 1881 he moved with her and her children to Poissy and within two years was living at Giverny, where he would remain for the rest of his life. He painted some of his famous scenes-the haystack and poplar series, for example- in 1890-91. Ernest Hoschedé died in 1891, and Monet married Alice the following year. At Giverny, Monet explored the themes of his garden and water lilies. He continued to travel, going to Norway in 1895, making three trips to London from 1899 through 1901, and taking Alice to Venice in 1908. The final years of his life were mainly spent working on his Great Decorations, large paintings of a water lily pond designed for two oval rooms at the Paris Orangerie. Monet is generally considered the most typical exponent of impressionism.",

      "fun_fact": "Madame Monet’s red cape draws the viewer’s attention beyond the glass of the French doors capturing her glance, a brief moment frozen in time. This painting was very special to Monet and he kept it with him for his entire life.",
      "digital_description": "This painting depicts Monet's first wife, Camille, outside on a snowy day passing by the French doors of their home at Argenteuil. Her face is rendered in a radically bold Impressionist technique of mere daubs of paint quickly applied, just as the snow and trees are defined by broad, broken strokes of pure white and green.",
      "wall_description": "In its early stages, this composition contained two figures seated inside the room on either side of the window. Monet radically altered the composition by painting over the figures. They were replaced by an image of the artist's favorite model---his wife Camille, who passes outside the window in a red cape. Intense light---reflected from the snow-covered landscape---floods the room, obliterating details along the walls and floor. The off-center window frame and the blurriness achieved through sketchy brushstrokes suggest the scanning movement of the artist's eye as he viewed this scene. Contrasted with cold blues and silver whites, Camille's red cape draws the viewer's attention through the glass and into a swift exchange of glances, registering a brief moment in time. This painting evidently held special meaning for Monet, for he kept it with him until his death in 1926.",

          "biography": "A leader of the symbolist movement in France, Odilon Redon was born in Bordeaux in 1840 and grew up in the surrounding region. During his early years he studied drawing, architecture, and the violin. A friendship with Armand Clavaud, a local botanist and philosopher, stimulated Redon's passion for romantic art and literature. In 1864, after a brief and discouraging period of instruction with Gérôme in Paris, Redon returned to Bordeaux, where he studied printmaking with Rodolphe Bresdin (1825-1885). Deploring the emphasis on rational, phenomenal experience in academic and naturalist art, Redon turned for inspiration to the imaginative paintings of Delacroix, the prints of Francisco José de Goya (1746-1828), and the poetry of Charles Baudelaire. In 1870, after military service in the Franco-Prussian War, Redon settled in Paris and produced his first <em>Noirs</em>. These visionary images, featuring floating eyes and severed heads born aloft on wings, reflect Redon's belief in the superiority of the imagination and fantasy, which he considered \"the messenger of the unconscious.\" After producing his initial <em>Noirs </em>in charcoal, Redon discovered a method of transferring his drawings to lithography in 1876. Throughout the 1880s he continued to use charcoal, etching, and lithography as his primary media, and he produced twelve lithography albums before abandoning the genre in the late 1890s. During the 1880s Redon emerged as a leader of the symbolist reaction against impressionism. The publication in 1879 of his first lithographic album, <em>Dans le rêve</em>, followed by his first solo exhibition in 1881, attracted the admiration of J. K. Huysmans, who included illustrations by Redon in his novel <em>À rebours</em> (1884). Around the same time, Redon developed a personal and artistic relationship with poet Stéphane Mallarmé. Increasingly drawn into the public arena, Redon helped organize the Société des Artistes Indépendants in 1884. In 1886 he participated in the last impressionist exhibition and began showing with Les XX in Brussels. Redon's antinaturalist, visionary, art inspired many symbolist and Nabi artists, including Gauguin and Vuillard. Maurice Denis praised Redon as \"our Mallarmé,\" and in 1892 critic Albert Aurier described Redon as a leader of the new \"idealistic\" tendency in art. After 1890 the focus of Redon's activity shifted from monochromatic drawings and prints toward exploring color in richly worked pastels. His innovations in luminous color, as seen in the pastel and oil paintings he exhibited at the Galeries Durand-Ruel in 1900 were greatly admired by Henri Matisse (1869-1954) and the Fauves. Awarded the Legion of Honor in 1903, Redon continued his leadership role in the avant-garde and in 1904 became a founding member of the Salon d'Automne. In 1913 forty of his works were selected for exhibition in the Armory Show, the most by any artist. Redon died at his home in Paris in the summer of 1916.",

      "digital_description": "Although he was known early in his career for works primarily in black and white, such as charcoal drawings and lithographs, Odilon Redon turned to more colorful media, including pastel, later on. In particular, he focused on commissioned pastel portraits of women with flowers, such as this one. Here, the young niece of the Parisian collector Marcel Kapferer appears alongside colorful blossoms as she looks forward, focused as if in the dreamlike state evoked by her surroundings.",
      "wall_description": "Like the lithographic portraits in this gallery, this pastel demonstrates a shift in Odilon Redon’s late work toward representing recognizable sitters. In this exceptionally large and finished drawing, he depicted the niece of Parisian collector Marcel Kapferer alongside a flowing backdrop of colorful blossoms. The young woman gazes forward, as if in the dreamlike state of her surroundings. When Kapferer sold the drawing in 1926 through New York City’s Kraushaar Galleries, an important vendor of contemporary art at the time, the museum was able to acquire it within just months of obtaining Redon’s <em>Orpheus,</em> seen nearby.",

The painting's foreground features an intersection of two dirt lanes, as well as a telephone pole emblazoned with political campaign posters. The artist seems to imply that American democracy is at a crossroads during this time of combat against the spread of fascism in Europe and Asia. Interestingly the work was inspired by the landscape around Cox's hometown of Terre Haute, Indiana, a location nicknamed \"The Crossroads of America\" due to the junction of major north-south and east-west national highways within its city limits. The museum purchased this painting out of a traveling exhibition entitled \"Artists for Victory,\" which consisted of works by artists who wanted to assist in the war effort. The exhibition opened at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York on the first anniversary of the bombing at Pearl Harbor.",

Although Church often extolled the grandeur of pristine American landscape in his work, this painting appears to have additional overtones. Created on the eve of the Civil War, the painting's subject can be interpreted as symbolically evoking the coming conflagration. Church's considerable technical skills and clever showmanship contributed to his fame as the premier artist of his generation. Rather than debut this painting in an annual exhibition with works by other artists as was the custom, Church instead exhibited it by itself at a prestigious art gallery. Coaxed by advance publicity and highly favorable press reviews, several hundred spectators flocked to admire it during its seven-week run.",

At the time, few American artists accepted women as private pupils. After her course of study, Wheeler joined her mother in launching a successful decorating firm, one of the first businesses in the country to be operated entirely by women. For the firm, she designed luxurious textiles, and the embroidered silk tapestry that fills the background in her portrait references her occupational interest. Chase's portrait was awarded a gold medal at an international exhibition of contemporary art in Munich in 1883, and later that year was also shown in Paris. At some later point, the painting was acquired by the sitter, who subsequently donated it to the museum.",

          "biography": "Son of a Parisian banker, Edgar Degas enrolled in law school in 1853 following his father's wishes. But he had already shown an interest in art and had also registered to copy at the Louvre. In 1855 he entered the École des Beaux-Arts and became a student of Louis Lamothe (1822-1869), a former pupil of Ingres (q.v.). One year later Degas made the traditional journey to Italy, remaining there for three years. He visited family members in Naples and Florence and attended life classes at the Villa Medici in Rome. A visit to Normandy in 1861 may have introduced him to the racetrack. In Paris he continued to study at the Louvre, where he met Manet (q.v.) in 1862. Apart from his continuous interest in portraiture and history painting, Degas began to pay attention to subjects of modern life. Between 1865 and 1870, he exhibited at the Salon. At the time of the Franco-Prussian War, he enlisted in the artillery, but because of his poor eyesight he served (with Manet) in the infantry. After the war he traveled first to London and, in 1872-73, visited his uncle and brothers who had a cotton business in New Orleans. Degas participated in the first impressionist exhibition of 1874. He continued to exhibit with these artists until 1886 but never completely considered himself a member of the group, preferring to call himself a realist or naturalist. While many of the impressionists painted en plein air, Degas worked with models in his studio and, later in his career, from his imagination. In addition to painting, he experimented often with monotypes, engraving, pastels, sculpture, and photography. He traveled extensively-London, Naples, Spain, Morocco, and Switzerland-but continued to draw his subject matter from modern-day Paris. Other recurring themes would be the female nude and the ballet dancer. After the impressionist exhibition of 1886, Degas no longer participated in group shows. Instead he sold his works to private dealers such as Durand-Ruel and Ambroise Vollard. In the 1890s he began his own art collection, which, besides many works on paper, included paintings by such artists as Ingres, Cézanne (q.v.), Delacroix (q.v.), Gauguin (q.v.), and van Gogh (q.v.). His own art at the time became characterized by broader strokes of paint, charcoal, and pastel and the use of more vibrant colors, partly because of problems with his vision. His failing eyesight and poor health caused him to abandon his pursuit of art during the last years of his life.",

The young woman is placed in an undefined setting, surrounded by mere wisps of color, applied so spontaneously that the paint ran and dripped. Degas even added the circles in the foreground with his thumb. Such audacity, while acceptable in a small sketch, must have shocked the artist's contemporaries when presented on a six-foot canvas. Equally radical is the idea of combining multiple views of a single figure. Degas's unusual presentation may have been inspired by the photographs of Eadweard Muybridge (1830-1904)",

          "biography": "Pablo Ruiz Picasso (1881-1973), the most prolific and influential artist of the 20th century, shifted the emphasis of art from its traditional concern with beauty toward radical innovation. The son of an art teacher, Picasso demonstrated remarkable talents as a child and entered the royal art academy in Madrid at age sixteen. Less than a year later, he abandoned his studies and soon joined several avant-garde artist and anarchist groups in Barcelona and Paris. After passing through a succession of stylistic periods, most notably the Blue (1901-1904) and Rose (1904-1906) Periods, he collaborated with Georges Braque (1882-1963) in 1908 to invent Cubism, a revolutionary method of restructuring pictorial space. Picasso remained active until his death in 1973. Although his art still appears radical, many of his works are over one hundred years old. Cubism, perhaps the most important development in 20th-century art, was invented around 1908 by Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) and Georges Braque (1882-1963). The most revolutionary aspect of the style was not its obvious emphasis on geometric form; rather, it was the introduction of a radically new approach to configuring pictorial space. Since the Renaissance, artists had used various methods to create the illusion of distant space receding behind the canvas surface. The Cubists rejected that idea and collapsed space by compressing foreground, middle ground, and background into a continuous web of overlapping, intersecting planes. During the 1910s, other painters and sculptors embraced or adapted Cubism to their own ends. This revolutionary approach inspired a host of related movements and continues to influence the visual language of artists, architects, and designers throughout the world.",

Only 21 years old and desperately poor, he restricted his palette to cold colors suggestive of night, mystery, dreams, and death. His obsession with themes of human misery and social alienation reached its climax with this painting. The subject has been interpreted variously as an allegory of sacred and profane love, a symbolic representation of the cycle of life, and a working-class couple facing the hazards of real life.",

Throngs of spectators line the riverbank and watch as Barney and John Biglin negotiate the tricky turn around a stake marking the halfway point in the contest. Their competitors, seen in the middle distance at the right, lag behind. The Biglin brothers won the race, cementing their status as the most celebrated oarsmen of the era. Trained in the United States and France, Eakins spent almost his entire artistic career in his hometown of Philadelphia. He is renowned for the unsentimental realism in his paintings, whose compositions he developed through painstakingly prepared figure and perspective drawings.",

          "biography": "The founder and leading painter of the neoclassical movement in France, Jacques-Louis David was born in Paris to a prosperous family of artists and archi-tects. In 1766 he entered the Académie Royale as the pupil of Joseph-Marie Vien (1716-1809). After several failed attempts, David won the Prix de Rome in 1774. The following year he left for Italy, where he studied antique art and envisioned replacing the frivolity of the rococo with an art of grandeur, simplicity, and moral virtue. After returning to Paris in 1780, he established his reputa-tion with three spectacular successes at the Salon: The Oath of the Horatii (1785, Musée du Louvre, Paris), The Death of Socrates (1787, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), and The Lictors Bring-ing Brutus the Bodies of His Sons (1789, Musée du Louvre, Paris). Widely interpreted as moral parables for contemporary political events, these archetypes of neoclassical aesthetics set the standard for academic painting of the next century. In the 1790s David joined the radical Jacobin Club and played an active role in the French Revolution. He allied himself with Robespierre, served a short term as president of the Convention, and voted for the execution of Louis XVI. He also placed his artistic talents at the service of the Revolution by creating paintings that glorified its martyrs and by organizing public festivals that celebrated the new political order. As the most prominent artist in the revolutionary ranks, he led the attack against the Académie Royale that culminated in its abolish-ment in 1793. When the excesses of the Reign of Terror precipitated the fall of Robespierre in 1794, David was imprison-ed but spared execution. Authorities released him the following year due to ill health. Around 1798 David developed a new alliance with the brilliant young general of the Directory, Napoléon Bonaparte. David's painting The Intervention of the Sabine Women (1799, Musée du Louvre, Paris) coalesced perfectly with Napoleonic propaganda urging national reconciliation. After the coup d'état of 1799, Napoléon was named first consul and began supplying David with important commissions. Upon Napoléon's coronation in 1804, David was appointed first painter to the emperor. David's monumental painting The Coronation of Napoléon, or Le Sacre (1805-7, Musée du Louvre, Paris), introduced a less spartan, more colorful and emotive style. However, as seen in his life-size portrait Napoléon in His Study (1812, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.), David increasingly searched to balance this new heroic-romanticism with an exacting realism. In 1816, following Napoléon's defeat at Waterloo and the restoration of the monarchy, David went into exile in Belgium. He spent the last nine years of his life in Brussels, painting mostly mythological subjects and portraits. David died of a stroke in 1825 and was denied burial in France.",

Back in his New York studio, he used these sketches to produce numerous majestic paintings, including this view of the distant granite peak Mount Starr King. Such scenes thrilled East Coast audiences and helped encourage early movements to save America’s natural wonders. In 1864, President Lincoln signed a bill preserving Yosemite as public property. The area became a national park in 1890.",

This work gains its power from the complex expressions of father and son, combining grief, strength, resignation, fear, and realization in their faces and bodies, the latter inspired by ancient sculpture and Michelangelo. Andrea del Sarto never finished this painting, and it lays bare his working methods. He transferred the design to the panel from a drawing, reinforcing the chalk with painted lines—best seen in the donkey at the far right. He then worked over the whole panel at once with thin, brushy veils of color, letting him alter the composition while painting—especially evident in the angel, Isaac’s body, and Abraham’s head.",

His wife, the Electress Sibylle, stands at right, poised to take the first ceremonial shot. The prince electors of Saxony were passionate practitioners of hunting with dogs—elaborate, highly rehearsed occasions, coordinated by the use of signals from hunting horns. Cranach dated this work and his signature is the winged snake at lower right. 1577 in the right corner is an inventory number.",

Pieces like the silver platter, delicate glasswares, thick rumpled carpet, and a Chinese porcelain bowl with peaches and an orange not only represented the great wealth and global reach of the Dutch trading empire, but were also a way for the artist to demonstrate his skill in recreating various surface textures. Kalf used different kinds of highlights to render reflections—quick dots, lines, and dabs of paint—creating sparkling, twinkling light effects that subtly distinguish objects from the surrounding shadows.<br>In 1797, the German poet Johann van Goethe wrote that Kalf's paintings lead to understanding \"in what sense art is superior to nature and what the spirit of man imparts to objects when it views them with creative eyes. . . . if I had to choose between the golden vessels or the picture . . . I would choose the picture.\"",

Artists such as Van Dyck transformed this tradition, which sent shockwaves through Genoa, instantly changing the direction of elite portraiture in the city. While the elaborate garb of this unidentified sitter and the scale of the image certainly mark her status, the warmth Van Dyck imparted to her face, the drama of the background, and the touching detail of the child spontaneously reaching upward add life, energy, and theatricality to the work.",

He was sentenced to die on the cross because he refused to acknowledge pagan gods. For two days, Andrew preached from his martyr’s station to an increasingly sympathetic crowd. Bowing to public demand, Andrew’s would-be executioners attempted to untie him, but their hands were mysteriously paralyzed. Andrew’s desire for martyrdom was thus fulfilled and he died enveloped in divine light. Caravaggio’s innovative interpretation involves the viewer more closely in the event by presenting the crucifixion as intimate and private, rather than as a gruesome public spectacle. Bold contrasts of light and dark suggest the presence of God. A masterpiece of Baroque painting, Caravaggio’s Crucifixion of Saint Andrew is the only altarpiece by the artist in America.",

His career, now spanning seven decades, has been devoted to documenting African-American life and history, from everyday scenes to the universal struggle for freedom, social justice, and human dignity. Moving to Harlem as a teenager in 1930, Lawrence was influenced by the artists, writers, and philosophers of the Harlem Renaissance-among them Romare Bearden, Langston Hughes, and W.E.B. DuBois-who fostered pride in African-American culture. Lawrence's subjects include the legendary abolitionist heroes Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, and John Brown, and the story of the massive migration of African Americans from the rural South to the industrialized, urban North during the early decades of the 20th century. After thorough research, Lawrence chronicles the crucial events of each saga by creating a series of small paintings on paper in a modernist style of flat, brightly-colored forms.",

In his <em>Portraits and Miniatures by Charles Willson Peale </em>(1952), Charles Coleman Sellers suggests that because the painting had been owned by Frisby Tilghman, it was probably painted for his father, Judge James Tilghman (1743-1809), who was well acquainted with the artist. This is purely conjecture, however, as there is no documentation confirming James Tilghman’s ownership of the painting."

Peale's painting was instantly popular, and the artist produced several versions of it amid a rally of enthusiasm for the American cause. Some were commissioned by American colonists, others were ordered by Washington's admirers in France, Spain, Holland, Cuba, and even England. One of the most remarkable figures in early American history, Peale was interested in natural history and organized the first scientific expedition in the United States. Later, he opened one of the first financially successful museums in America, displaying stuffed animal specimens, fossils, shells, and a large selection of his portrait paintings.",

In Paris Daumier studied drawing with Alexandre Lenoir (1761-1839) and at the Académie Suisse. Around 1825 he began a five-year apprenticeship with the publisher and lithographer Zépherin Belliard (1798-?). The July revolution of 1830, which established Louis-Philippe as the constitutional monarch in France, coincided with Daumier's creation of satirical lithographs aimed at this new government. That same year he joined La Caricature, a political journal founded by the republican artist-publisher, Charles Philipon (1802-1862). Daumier's antimonarchist and liberal subjects that were printed in this paper eventually cost the journal censorship and the artist six months in jail (31 August 1832 to 14 February 1833) plus a 300-franc fine. His prison sentence did not deter him from producing political statements and, in fact, only fueled his rage. The subjects of his lithographs became much more aggressive. In 1835 he worked for Philipon's second publication, Le Charivari, a humorous political newspaper that published Daumier's satirical caricature until it, too, suffered censorship under the new government. Although Daumier may be best known for his graphic art, he was also a sculptor and a prolific painter. Sculpture became another medium to produce his infamous caricatures. His friend, Honoré de Balzac, French novelist and editor of La Caricature, saw in these works the force of Michelangelo. In 1834 Daumier began experimenting with painting, both in oil and watercolor. Apart from his Salon entries of 1849 and 1850, his paintings, which totaled over three hundred, were painted primarily for his own pleasure and virtually unknown to the public until after his death in 1879.",

The Vollard register from May 1899 lists “2 Daumier pendants guitariste et mère et enfant” – lots 132 and 133 in the Doria sale from that month. In 1908 Vollard seems to have consigned the Daumier to H.O. Miethke, a Vienna dealer who often acted as an intermediary in Vollard’s foreign trade activities. The Daumier is No. 42 in <em>Honoré Daumier, 1808-1879,</em> an exhibition held at Galerie Miethke in November-December 1980. The painting apparently failed to sell and was returned to Vollard: the Cassirer Archive, held by the Walter Feilchenfeldt Gallery, records the sale of \"Le Guitarist\"by Vollard to Cassirer on October 28, 1912."

            "A photograph, dated 1928, shows <em>The Troubadour</em> prominently displayed on a wall in the “Daumier-Zimmers” in Fuchs’ Berlin villa. In 1930, Fuchs, a collector, writer, and historian with a passion for Daumier, published <em>Der Maler Daumier,</em> a catalogue of the artist’s work. In it he notes that <em>The Troubadour</em> (there titled <em>Der Page</em>) was currently in his collection; he also lent the painting to an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art that year. In February of 1933, Fuchs and his wife Margaret fled to Paris; on October 25 of that same year his collection was confiscated by the Gestapo. <em>The Troubadour, </em>however, along with several other Daumier paintings, appears to have avoided confiscation: it may have been among nine unspecified Daumier paintings for which Fuchs transferred ownership to his friend Felix Weil as security for a loan. These paintings were sent to Rotterdam, thus securing their safety. Furthermore, no references to <em>The Troubadour </em>in databases or lists of Nazi-looted art have been located, nor is the painting listed in any of the five Nazi-era sales of the Fuchs collection (Lepke, June 16-17. 1937; Lepke, Oct. 15-16, 1937; Lepke, Nov. 4-5, 1937; Lepke, June 22-24, 1938; Boerner, May 23-24, 1938). These auctions took place after the director of the Berlin Nationalgalerie, Eberhard Hanfstaengl, was able to convince the Gestapo that the confiscation of the Fuchs collection, just before the 1936 Olympics, would harm the cultural reputation of Germany. Thus, the collection was granted provisional release in 1935. Fuchs’ daughter was nevertheless forced to sell off her father’s collection in order to settle the tax liabilities he faced after the return of the collection."

          "biography": "The son of a clergyman, Vincent van Gogh was sent to The Hague at the age of sixteen to become an apprentice at Goupil &amp; Co., an art dealer with whom his uncle was affiliated. In August 1872 van Gogh began his extensive correspondence with his younger brother Theo, who would join the Brussels branch of the firm the following year. Vincent was transferred to the London offices in 1873 and two years later to the Paris office, but he despised the art trade and was dismissed in 1876. He then taught briefly at a boarding school in Ramsgate and Isleworth, and, back in the Netherlands, worked in a bookshop in Dordrecht before moving to Amsterdam to study theology. In little more than a year he had left the university and entered missionary school, failing again. Still intent on entering the ministry, he moved to the Borinage in Belgium and became a lay evangelist to the miners. Van Gogh finally decided to become an artist in August 1880 and started copying works by Millet (q.v.), the painter of peasant life. With his brother's financial help, he briefly joined the Academy in Brussels. The following year he returned to The Hague, where he received some artistic training from his cousin by marriage, Anton Mauve (1838-1888). There van Gogh met Sien Hoornik, a pregnant prostitute with a five-year-old daughter, with whom he lived briefly. Unable to marry her because of his family's disapproval, he moved in November 1883 from The Hague to the province of Drenthe, a popular place for artists, where he painted and drew laborers and peasants. Feeling terribly lonely, he visited his parents in December 1884 in Nuenen, and it was there that he finally decided to become a painter of peasant life. Van Gogh completed The Potato Eaters (Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam) in April 1885 and sent it to his brother in Paris. On 25 November he moved to Antwerp, where he reveled in the work of Rubens and first came to know Japanese prints. Van Gogh traveled to Paris in March 1886 and lived with Theo. Under the influence of the impressionists, and works by Monticelli (q.v.), his palette changed to more intense and vibrant colors. He began to associate with Émile Bernard (1868-1941), Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864-1901), Degas (q.v.), Gauguin (q.v.), Pissarro (q.v.), and Seurat (q.v.) and started collecting some of their paintings as well as Japanese prints. He moved to Arles in February 1888. Apart from paintings, he also made some drawings because it was a cheaper medium. Theo encouraged him to submit to the Salon des Indépendants. In May Vincent rented a room in the Yellow House, even though he could hardly afford to do so, and continued to send his work to his brother. In June he became intrigued with the subject of the wheat harvest and painted The Sower (Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo). On 23 October 1888, Gauguin arrived in Arles, at a time when van Gogh was having trouble with his eyesight. Gauguin encouraged him to paint from memory, which resulted in Memory of the Garden in Etten (Hermitage, St. Petersburg). The artists, however, had many disagreements, and during a dramatic quarrel on 23 December van Gogh mutilated his ear. He was taken into a hospital in Arles, and Gauguin left for Paris. Van Gogh recovered rapidly and was dismissed on 7 January 1889. In February his neighbors objected to his presence in the Yellow House, and he had to return to the hospital. In April Theo married Johanna Gesina Bonger, who would eventually safeguard most of Vincent's oeuvre. Aware of his mental problems, at the end of April van Gogh checked himself into the asylum of Saint-Paul-de-Mausole in Saint-Rémy, where he was treated by Dr. Peyron. His condition was stable, and he was allowed to work in a makeshift studio. He worked in the garden (Irises, J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles) and painted the fields he could see from his window. Under supervision he painted in the countryside, rendering cypresses and olive trees. Starry Night (Museum of Modern Art, New York) also stems from this period. From July through September he suffered from a severe depression that prevented him from working. He resumed his work from October through December, painting well-known Provençal works and adapting prints after Delacroix (q.v.), Millet, and Rembrandt (1606-1669). In January 1890 he exhibited five works with Les XX in Brussels, selling one of them. After a visit to Arles at the end of February, he became ill again but continued to work. He finally left the asylum, and visited Theo in Paris on his way to Auvers, where he arrived on 20 May. He became close friends with Dr. Gachet and rented a room at the inn of the Ravoux family. He painted the village, portraits, and the surrounding wheat fields. On 27 July 1890, during an episode of depression, van Gogh shot himself in the chest and died two days later.",

Although for most of her career she was a prolific artist, Sage increasingly lost her momentum and inspiration during widowhood. Unable to endure living with her loss, she became reclusive and depressed, eventually succeeding in her second attempt at suicide by shooting herself in the heart.",

The facial structure of the saint as well as the artist’s treatment of his cloak are typical of van Eyck’s follower, Petrus Christus. Christus was active in the city of Bruges and was a probable pupil and successor to Jan van Eyck, with whom his paintings have often been confused. Here, Christus depicts John the Baptist as an isolated, monumental figure without his typical hairshirt or other references to his life. This approach is derived from Claus Sluter’s monumental image of Saint John from the portal at Champmol and from manuscript illuminators working for Philip the Bold and his brother Jean de Berry. Here, John holds the Lamb of God, a symbol of Christ’s sacrifice and a reference to John’s proclamation of Christ’s redemption of humankind. Upon his death, Christus was succeeded by Hans Memling as the next great painter in Bruges.",

Its subject tells the story of a winged angel of death who races through the heavens on horseback to rescue a woman from a life of suffering.

Featuring elaborate arches, a favorite motif that appeared throughout Bugatti's furniture, this fantastical imagery is a window into the designer's expressive imagination.",
      "wall_description": "Elaborate patterns of marquetry along with gilt-metal mounts based on highly stylized insect forms—motifs that dominated Carlo Bugatti's imagination through much of his career—adorn this fantastical tea table. Bugatti's use of ovoid arches as supporting elements also reflects his continued fascination with an Art Nouveau motif. Seldom has so much care and skill been brought to bear in the creation of luxury objects that were actually designed more to amaze and delight the viewer than to be truly useful. This tea set, salver, and table, together with some now missing cups, were all designed by Bugatti as an ensemble. They were probably acquired from his 1907 exhibition at the Galerie Hébrard in Paris by a wealthy South African widow, Anna Blake, who was living there at the time. It is said that Bugatti's work appealed to her because it reminded her of Africa. Some of the animal and insect motifs suggest mythical beasts or the fossils of prehistoric animals. When Mrs. Blake returned to Cape Town, she took these and other pieces designed by Bugatti with her, and they remained in South Africa until acquired by the Cleveland Museum of Art.",

Ants cluster over the face of the central figure, obscuring the mouth, while the sealed, bulging eyelids suggest the sensory confusion and frustration of a dream. The man at the far left - with a bleeding face and amputated left foot - refers to the classical myth of Oedipus, who unwittingly killed his father and married his mother. The column that grows from the man’s back and sprouts into a bust of a bearded man refers to the Freudian father, the punishing superego who suppresses the son’s sexual fantasies. In the distance, two men embrace, one holding a golden key or scepter symbolizing access to the unconscious. Behind them, a naked man reaches into a permeable red form, as if trying to enter it.",

Framed in the center by a halo (recalling her sun god grandfather Helios), the sorceress Medea flies off in a dragon-drawn chariot. Seeking revenge against her husband Jason, leader of the Argonauts, Medea has just slain their two children. Two Furies flank her, while Jason and a distraught nurse and teacher approach the bodies on the altar below. <br><br>A different tragedy unfolds on the other side of the vase, from Euripides’s <em>Telephos</em> (438 BC). The wounded warrior Telephos holds the baby Orestes hostage at an altar, with Agamemnon and Clytemnestra rushing to save their son.",

In his memoir of 1913, <em>A Small Boy and Others</em>, his son, novelist Henry James recalls the painting, which \"covered half a side of our front parlor” of the family’s brownstone on West 14th Street in Manhattan.  He writes that, as of 1913, the painting was \"long ago lost to our sight;\" apparently, it was no longer in the possession of any member of the James family by this point. The painting’s whereabouts from 1854 to circa 1960 remain unknown. In 1855, the James family moved to Europe, returning in 1859 to reside mainly in Newport, Rhode Island, where they lived until 1865, when Henry James, Sr. sold the 14th Street house and settled the family in Cambridge. The 14th Street house was sold to William Benton Greene [1819-1904], who had rented it while the James family resided elsewhere. Alfred Habegger, a noted Henry James scholar, suggested that the painting may have remained on the walls of the James home when they moved to Europe and that Greene “inherited” the painting with the house."

Edward James was the uncle of novelist Henry James; he lived in Albany and is among the lesser known members of the James family. In some versions of the provenance of <em>View of Florence, </em>Edward James is followed by Thomas Parkman Cushing, who is then followed by Henry James, Sr. In her entry on <em>View of Florence </em>in the exhibition catalogue, <em>A Lost World: Masterpieces of American Painting , 1760-1910</em> (1983), Diana Strazdes situated the painting in the possession of Thomas Parkman Cushing in 1850, when he lent a Cole painting titled “View on the Arno, near Florence” to an exhibition at the Boston Athenaeum. It seems that Strazdes likely confused <em>View of Florence </em>with <em>View of the Arno, near Florence </em>(Worcester Art Museum, 1991.179), assigning the Cushing provenance to <em>View of Florence </em>which in fact it belongs to <em>View of the Arno. </em>"

          "biography": "A leader of the symbolist movement in France, Odilon Redon was born in Bordeaux in 1840 and grew up in the surrounding region. During his early years he studied drawing, architecture, and the violin. A friendship with Armand Clavaud, a local botanist and philosopher, stimulated Redon's passion for romantic art and literature. In 1864, after a brief and discouraging period of instruction with Gérôme in Paris, Redon returned to Bordeaux, where he studied printmaking with Rodolphe Bresdin (1825-1885). Deploring the emphasis on rational, phenomenal experience in academic and naturalist art, Redon turned for inspiration to the imaginative paintings of Delacroix, the prints of Francisco José de Goya (1746-1828), and the poetry of Charles Baudelaire. In 1870, after military service in the Franco-Prussian War, Redon settled in Paris and produced his first <em>Noirs</em>. These visionary images, featuring floating eyes and severed heads born aloft on wings, reflect Redon's belief in the superiority of the imagination and fantasy, which he considered \"the messenger of the unconscious.\" After producing his initial <em>Noirs </em>in charcoal, Redon discovered a method of transferring his drawings to lithography in 1876. Throughout the 1880s he continued to use charcoal, etching, and lithography as his primary media, and he produced twelve lithography albums before abandoning the genre in the late 1890s. During the 1880s Redon emerged as a leader of the symbolist reaction against impressionism. The publication in 1879 of his first lithographic album, <em>Dans le rêve</em>, followed by his first solo exhibition in 1881, attracted the admiration of J. K. Huysmans, who included illustrations by Redon in his novel <em>À rebours</em> (1884). Around the same time, Redon developed a personal and artistic relationship with poet Stéphane Mallarmé. Increasingly drawn into the public arena, Redon helped organize the Société des Artistes Indépendants in 1884. In 1886 he participated in the last impressionist exhibition and began showing with Les XX in Brussels. Redon's antinaturalist, visionary, art inspired many symbolist and Nabi artists, including Gauguin and Vuillard. Maurice Denis praised Redon as \"our Mallarmé,\" and in 1892 critic Albert Aurier described Redon as a leader of the new \"idealistic\" tendency in art. After 1890 the focus of Redon's activity shifted from monochromatic drawings and prints toward exploring color in richly worked pastels. His innovations in luminous color, as seen in the pastel and oil paintings he exhibited at the Galeries Durand-Ruel in 1900 were greatly admired by Henri Matisse (1869-1954) and the Fauves. Awarded the Legion of Honor in 1903, Redon continued his leadership role in the avant-garde and in 1904 became a founding member of the Salon d'Automne. In 1913 forty of his works were selected for exhibition in the Armory Show, the most by any artist. Redon died at his home in Paris in the summer of 1916.",

      "digital_description": "Drawn in vivid layers of pastel crayon, this work depicts the head of the poet and musician Orpheus. The story of the god of music, whose music carried on after his death through his lyre and head, fascinated Redon, who related to Orpheus's dedication to his art. The subject also aligned with Redon's broader interest in dreams and spirituality around this time and he represented Orpheus several times throughout his career, in various media. Here, the god's head floats as if in stasis while Mount Parnassus—the home of Apollo and the Muses—soars from behind.",
      "wall_description": "Considered by Odilon Redon to be one of his greatest works in any media, this drawing portrays the head of the mythical god of music. Redon contrasted powdery purple and ochre pastel to represent the figure’s head and lyre, through which Orpheus’s music carried on after his death. An alternative version of the work was included in the 1913 Armory Show—regarded as the first American exhibition of modern art—where it captured the attention of Cleveland Museum of Art curator William Milliken. When this drawing became available at auction, the museum’s early supporters banded together to raise funds; the acquisition attracted international press attention.",

          "biography": "Claude Monet spent his youth in Le Havre in Normandy, where his father worked as a wholesale grocer. By the age of sixteen, he had exhibited some of his caricatures in an art supply store, leading to his acquaintance with Boudin (q.v.). It was Boudin who first encouraged him to paint out of doors. In 1859 Monet traveled to Paris, where he saw Boudin's salon debut and met Constant Troyon (1810-1865). A year later he joined the Académie Suisse, where he was introduced to Pissarro (q.v.), but his studies were interrupted in 1861 when he was drafted for a seven-year stint in the military. His family would pay for his release from military duties only if he gave up painting. Finding this unacceptable, Monet served for one year in Algeria before an early return to France to convalesce after a severe illness. In 1862 he met Jongkind (q.v.), another important influence on the young painter's development. Monet's father then allowed him to pursue his art career in Paris, where he entered the studio of the Swiss painter Charles Gleyre (1806-1874). He studied with Gleyre until 1864 and befriended Frédéric Bazille (1841-1870), Renoir (q.v.), and Sisley (q.v.), with whom he painted in the forest of Fontainebleau (Déjeuner sur l'herbe, 1865, two fragments in Musée d'Orsay, Paris). Monet first exhibited at the Salon of 1865 and would do so again in 1866, 1868, and 1880. In 1868 he shared a studio with Bazille and Renoir but was soon forced to leave Paris to escape his creditors. He took his mistress, Camille Doncieux, and their son, Jean, to Fécamp, then Étretat, and finally Saint-Michel. There Renoir provided hospitality, and the two also painted at the boating and bathing center of La Grenouillère on the Seine. In 1870 Monet married Camille and, to escape the Franco-Prussian War, left for London, where he remained for nine months and met Durand-Ruel, his first dealer. In the summer of 1871 he visited the Netherlands and then settled in Argenteuil, to the west of Paris. He converted a boat into a studio, as Daubigny (q.v.) had done before him, allowing him to explore different viewpoints for his landscapes. He assisted in the organization of the First Impressionist Exhibition in 1874, partly because Durand-Ruel's worsened business situation had prevented the dealer from buying his art. The following year he participated in the Hôtel Drouot sale with Morisot (q.v.), Renoir, and Sisley. In 1878 Monet and his wife moved to Vétheuil with the Hoschedés, who had previously commissioned some works. Camille died the following year, and, while Ernest Hoschedé spent most of his time in Paris trying to settle his precarious financial situation, Monet stayed behind with Ernest's wife, Alice. In 1881 he moved with her and her children to Poissy and within two years was living at Giverny, where he would remain for the rest of his life. He painted some of his famous scenes-the haystack and poplar series, for example- in 1890-91. Ernest Hoschedé died in 1891, and Monet married Alice the following year. At Giverny, Monet explored the themes of his garden and water lilies. He continued to travel, going to Norway in 1895, making three trips to London from 1899 through 1901, and taking Alice to Venice in 1908. The final years of his life were mainly spent working on his Great Decorations, large paintings of a water lily pond designed for two oval rooms at the Paris Orangerie. Monet is generally considered the most typical exponent of impressionism.",

      "fun_fact": "Water lilies were a recurring theme in Monet's work: he painted around 250 water lily compositions.",
      "digital_description": "Monet spent the last thirty years of his life painting the lily pond at his home in Giverny, a small town on the river Seine, just north of Paris. While his initial exploration of the water lily theme (1902-8) produced smaller works more descriptive of a garden setting, the later paintings focus on the water's shimmering surface, indicating the surrounding trees and lush bank only through reflections. Here reflection and reality merge in strokes of blue, violet, and green. Fronds of water plants sway underwater and passing clouds are reflected above. By 1915 Monet had conceived a plan, called his Grande Décoration, for arranging a series of monumental water lily paintings in an oval room, thus creating a continuous panorama that would surround and enclose the viewer in an environment of pure color. <br>The CMA painting was originally the left panel of a triptych titled <em>Agapanthus</em> (<em>Nymphéas</em> in French) that featured agapanthus growing in the foreground. At the end of World War I, Monet proposed a plan of installing the triptych together with several others in a building constructed on the grounds of the current Musée Rodin in Paris. However, the French government did not have the funds to finance such a project in the postwar era. A new idea was subsequently proposed of installing a series of these panoramic paintings in an existing building, the Orangerie near the Louvre. As the building was being prepared, Monet continued painting more works for the project and at some point repainted the Agapanthus triptych, during which the agapanthus were eliminated, leaving mostly water lilies floating in the water. Hence, the former Agapanthus triptych has become known as the <em>Water Lilies (Agapanthus) </em>triptych. <br>When Monet died in 1926 none of his works had yet been installed in the Orangerie. A selection was placed there the following year, but it did not include <em>Water Lilies (Agapanthus)</em> triptych, which remained in the artist's studio under the care of his family until the 1950s, when the three panels were sold separately to American museums. The companion paintings are currently in the collections of the St. Louis Art Museum and the Nelson-Atkins Museum in Kansas City, Missouri.",
      "wall_description": "Monet spent the last thirty years of his life painting the lily pond at his home in Giverny, a small town on the river Seine, just north of Paris. While his initial exploration of the water lily theme (1902-8) produced smaller works more descriptive of a garden setting, the later paintings focus on the water's shimmering surface, indicating the surrounding trees and lush bank only through reflections. Here reflection and reality merge in strokes of blue, violet, and green. Fronds of water plants sway underwater and passing clouds are reflected above. By 1915 Monet had conceived a plan, called his Grande Décoration, for arranging a series of monumental water lily paintings in an oval room, thus creating a continuous panorama that would surround and enclose the viewer in an environment of pure color. That installation is located in two oval rooms in the Musée de l'Orangerie in Paris. Cleveland's painting is the left panel of a three-part variation on this water lily theme. Its companions are now in the St. Louis Art Museum and the Nelson-Atkins Museum in Kansas City, Missouri.",

          "biography": "In 1845 Arnold Böcklin enrolled for two years at the Düsseldorf academy in the landscape class of Johann Wilhelm Schirmer (1807-1863). Böcklin traveled to Brussels and Antwerp, where he admired Flemish paintings, and then continued his studies with the landscape painter Alexandre Calame (1810-1864) in Geneva. In Paris during the tumultuous February and June Revolutions of 1848, Böcklin copied Old Master paintings at the Louvre. Couture's (q.v.) Romans of the Decadence (1847, Musée d'Orsay, Paris) made a strong impression on him, as did Corot's (q.v.) atmospheric treat-ment of landscapes. After a short stay in Basel, Böcklin moved to Rome in 1850 and married Angela Pascucci three years later. In 1857 he returned via Basel to Hannover, where he decorated the dining room in the Wedekind mansion (1858). He hoped this commission would relieve his financial burdens, but Wedekind was far from pleased with the result. Böcklin's first major success occurred when he exhibited Pan in the Reeds (Bayerische Staatsgemäldesammlungen, Munich) in 1859 in Munich. King Ludwig I bought the work, and soon after Böcklin started teaching in Weimar (1860-62). In Munich he met Baron von Schack, who became one of his most important supporters. From 1862 through 1866 he lived in Rome and while there was in touch with Anselm Feuerbach (1829-1880) and Hans von Marées (1837-1887). The trio formed the nucleus of the late-nineteenth-century \"Deutschrömer\" (German Romans) who continued a tradition of German artists working in Italy using a classical vocabulary. Böcklin moved repeatedly, living in Basel (1866-71), Munich (1871-74), Florence (1874-85), and Zurich (1885-92) until he finally settled in Florence in 1892. In Basel he painted the murals for the Museum an der Augustinergasse (1868-70); Jacob Burckhardt's criticism of these works ended their close friendship. At the end of his career he had built a solid reputation and was praised as a distinctively German artist. His seven-tieth birthday was celebrated with exhibitions in Basel and Berlin. With other movements such as impressionism and modernism taking over, however, the esteem for his art soon diminished after his death in 1901. Except for the attention of artists like Giorgio de Chirico (1888-1978) and other surrealists, recognition of Böcklin's work did not reappear until the second half of the twentieth century.

          "biography": "With Turner (q.v.), his exact contemporary, John Constable defined the parameters of genius for a generation of romantic landscape painters. The son of a prosperous miller and gentleman farmer, he entered into his profession late and was basically self-taught. Between 1796 and 1799 Constable had the advice of several artists and connoisseurs influential in the London art scene, primarily that of Sir George Beaumont (1753-1827), John Thomas Smith (1766-1833), and Joseph Farington (1747-1821). With the grudging consent of his parents, he entered the Royal Academy schools in 1799, the same year Turner was elected an associate member. (Twenty years would elapse before the academy conceded Constable that gesture of recognition.) He emerged publicly as a mature and focused painter of naturalistic landscapes in 1802 with the exhibition of his first oil painting at the Royal Academy.1 Shortly afterward he moved to his family home in East Bergholt with the intention of getting \"a pure and unaffected representation of the scenes that may employ me.\" The tours of 1806 produced an important body of Lake District material, especially studies in watercolor and in graphite, a medium Constable employed with unrivaled ability even at this early date. In 1808 he began a period of intense plein-air oil sketching and by 1814 was painting finished pictures like the magnificent Stour Valley and Dedham Village (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) or Wivenhoe Park, Essex (National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C.)2 entirely out of doors. The Stour River, Flatford Mill, and Dedham Vale were the subjects to which he returned repeatedly with brilliant success. With his bride, Maria Bicknell, the artist moved permanently to London in 1816. His repertoire of subjects would expand to include Brighton, Salisbury, and Hampstead Heath, and both his practice and his fortunes also evolved in a significant new direction when he began his six-foot pictures of Suffolk landscape painted in the London studio. The scale of such works as The White Horse (1819, Frick Collection, New York)3 undoubtedly contributed to his successful bid for associate membership in the Royal Academy that year. With Sir Thomas Lawrence (1769-1830) and Bonington (q.v.), Constable created a sensation at the 1824 Paris Salon, where he exhibited The Hay Wain (National Gallery, London) and View on the Stour near Dedham (Huntington Art Gallery, San Marino),4 although French artists had known and admired his work since 1820. After the death of his wife in 1828 and his election as full academician in 1829, Constable turned toward consolidating his reputation through writing, lecturing, and the medium of printmaking. He published English Landscape (1830-32) in collaboration with the mezzotint engraver David Lucas, but it was commercially unsuccessful. He never ceased to work from nature, but the later masterworks Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows (1831, National Gallery, London), The Opening of Waterloo Bridge (1832, Tate Gallery, London), and Arundel Mill and Castle (1837, Toledo Museum of Art)5 are pictures in which an expressionistic use of the medium struggles against an ever-increasing imaginative formalization of natural motifs.\r\n1.

In Duncanson’s conception, members of a courtly entourage depart a quasi-Islamic palace, arriving by boat onto a scrim of land where they ascend a monumental staircase to a plaza with a fountain spraying an impressive plume of water. Despite these substantial storytelling details, the human elements remain subordinate to the overwhelming splendor of the natural landscape in and of itself.",

Though the artist who created it is unknown, he was unquestionably inspired by the great Gothic buildings of his time. <br>The table fountain is a three-tiered assembly combining cast elements with bent sheets of gilt-silver. To these have been attached a series of enamel plaques representing grotesque figures, some of which play musical instruments. Water wheels and bells were added to capture motion and sound. <br>The rich detail, precious materials, and involved ornamentation of this deluxe object suggest it would have been expensive to produce and highly treasured by its original owner, someone of high status, and would have been deployed as an object of spectacle. This is the most complete example of its type known to survive from the Middle Ages. Medieval inventories reveal that small fountains like this, often taking various forms, and generally made from precious metals, once existed in large numbers, thus making the Cleveland table fountain an extremely rare object.",

      "wall_description": "Bouts was the son of the painter Dieric, from a family of painters in Leuven. He specialized in small devotional paintings for a ready market in Antwerp and other Flemish cities. This painting depicts an important event in the life of Mary—the Annunciation by the angel Gabriel that she will conceive and bear a son. The Incarnation of Christ is believed to have taken place at precisely this moment. The prevalence of this scene in medieval Christian art reflects its doctrinal importance and its role as a meditative event. The Virgin is represented here in a luxurious private chapel. The vase with lilies on the floor symbolizes her purity. The orange on the window sill is a symbol of chastity and generosity, and the closed book suggests the Old Testament prophecies have now been fulfilled. Mary is praying from her book of hours, much like an affluent merchant’s wife in medieval Bruges or Antwerp. Books of hours, private devotional books for lay people, were at their peak of popularity, especially among women. Startled by the angel, she seems to turn slightly to greet him. Both the angel and Mary are wrapped in sumptuous draperies, perhaps a reflection of the importance of the Flemish cloth industry. Surprised by the angel Gabriel's sudden appearance and his message that she will bear the son of God, the Mary rises from prayer. The artist sets the scene in a room with decor and furnishings familiar to viewers of his time. Though religious, paintings like this offer a glimpse of life among the urban elite. The small size of the panel suggests that it was used for private devotions (much like the altarpiece behind the Virgin), and also prized as a highly finished collector's item.",

According to Hindu thought, time is cyclical; the world is created, maintained, preserved for a time, then destroyed, only to be created again an infinite number of times. For those Hindus who view Shiva to be the all-powerful creator divinity, he is responsible for both creation and destruction. The ring of fire and the tongue of flame he holds in his left hand refer to destruction, and the drum in his raised right hand refers to the relentless beat of time as it moves inevitably forward. His lower right hand, held up with the palm facing out, signals to his devotees not to be afraid of the impending destruction; they can be liberated from the cycles of birth and death through devotion to him, which he indicates by pointing to his upraised foot. With every step in his dance, he lands on a dwarfish figure personifying ignorance.",

      "wall_description": "At the age of 25, Rembrandt moved from his hometown of Leiden to the bustling city of Amsterdam. Within a few years he had become one of the city’s most successful portrait painters, creating remarkably vivid likenesses that seemed to express the personality and soul of the sitter. Here, Rembrandt used smooth, fluid brushstrokes to recreate the soft texture of the woman’s skin. In contrast, thicker, more textured strokes draw attention to the lavish display of her lace collar and gold jewelry—details sure to please a wealthy client. The extraordinary demand at that time for a portrait by Rembrandt meant that in many cases (including, probably, this painting) he called upon assistants to help complete the work.",

The apostle’s red-rimmed eyes and the uncertain light of the lantern suggest anxious sleepless nights; muted colors and simple forms give visual expression to Peter’s somber emotions. Unlike other artists inspired by Caravaggio, La Tour worked in relative isolation in northeastern France, and his connection to his Italian counterpart remains unclear.",

          "biography": "Friedrich Amerling grew up in a poor working-class milieu and started his career illuminating maps and prints before attending the Vienna academy from 1815 until 1824. The following two years he studied at the academy in Prague, until his sojourn in London from 1827 through 1828. Amerling went to London primarily to meet the portraitist Thomas Lawrence (1769-1830), whose fame had spread throughout Europe and whose work, together with that of Joshua Reynolds (1723-1792), would form an important influence on Amerling's art. After a brief stay in Paris, during which Amerling met Vernet (q.v.), he went on to Rome. Back in Vienna he painted the life-size portrait of Emperor Franz I (1832/33, Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), which, despite its mixed reviews, estab-lished his reputation as the foremost portrait painter in Vienna. From then on he received many portrait commissions from the Viennese aristocracy and bourgeoisie (see Waldmüller, Countess Széchenyi, fig. 223b). In 1833 Amerling traveled to the Netherlands and, upon his return, visited the artistic centers of Munich and Düsseldorf, where he met the influential academy director Friedrich Wilhelm von Schadow (1788-1862). Amerling's career reached its height from the 1830s through the 1850s. In the early 1840s he traveled to Rome where he worked with Leopold Pollak (1806-1880) and August Riedel (1799-1883), who influenced his work with their depictions of Italian beauties. Besides painting formal portraits, Amerling developed a painting category that remained close to portraiture but crossed over to a slightly sentimental type of genre or character painting, mostly depicting single women in coquettish poses. Although Amerling retained a certain popularity throughout his long career-he was knighted in 1879-he failed to adapt to changing artistic developments and was eventually overshadowed by artists such as Hans Makart (1840-1884).",

The inscription on the rim of the Wade Cup is the pinnacle of this form of script with its full-figure animation. The body of the cup is covered with interlacing bands of compartments containing tiny figures of humans and animals. These represent the 12 signs of the zodiac from astrology, the practice of interpreting the influence of planets and stars on earthly affairs. Astrology began in Mesopotamia, was adopted by the Greeks, and then absorbed into medieval Islamic culture through translations of Greek texts.",

            "1Bohnewand, a successful tobacconist and art collector, purchased the de Witte at the Stroefer sale according to the price list in the Böhler archives. Ilse Manke’s 1963 monograph on de Witte situates the painting in 1953 with “Kunsthandel Steinmeyer, Munich,” a gallery founded by Julius Wilhelm Böhler and Fritz Steinmeyer in Lucerne (not Munich). This reference is most likely erroneous, as the painting remained with Bohnewand until his death and was sold in the posthumous sale of his collection in 1969.  Prior to Steinmeyer, Manke gives the following provenance, in reverse chronological order: Bohnewand; a Berlin private collection; and Stroefer. The Berlin private collector is likely Bohnewand, given what we know about his dates of ownership of the painting. Volume XXXVI of Thieme-Becker, published in 1947, also situates the painting in a Berlin private collection, which, again, must refer to Bohnewand. The provenance given by Thieme-Becker for the CMA painting lists the Stroefer sale and then notes, “zuletzt bei Ed. Plietzsch,” which indicates that the most recent owner had been Eduard Plietzsch. Plietzsch was specialist in Dutch and Flemish painting who played a large role in the development of Goering’s collection as the chief assistant to Kajetan Mühlmann, a major figure in the Nazi art confiscations. The reference to Plietzsch in connection with the CMA painting appears incorrect: First, we know that the painting was with Bohnewand from 1937 until his posthumous sale in 1969. Second, there is no documentary evidence confirming Plietzsch’s ownership of this painting, and in fact, it’s possible that at some point the provenance of the CMA painting was confused with that of other paintings of church interiors by de Witte that were connected to Plietzsch, whether before or after the Stroefer sale: <em>Interior of a Church </em>was confiscated from the Jaffe collection (Munich Central Collecting Point no. 4061) by the Dienststelle Mühlmann, and two de Witte church interior scenes appear in the liquidation sales of the Berlin branch of Plietzsch’s gallery, Galerie van Diemen (Paul Graupe, Jan. 25th and April 26th, 1935)."

In the late 1500s, militant Protestant sects occupied Catholic churches in the Netherlands and stripped them of rich decorations and “idolatrous” images. The resulting spare, whitewashed interiors became a favorite subject of Dutch artists, who were intrigued by the interplay of light and shadow over the unadorned walls, and by the challenge of depicting perspectival space.",

This deluxe manuscript was created for her private devotions by highly organized and distinctly talented manuscript painters active in Ghent and Bruges. The Ghent-Bruges school represents the culmination of Flemish book painting, whose main features were the use of rich colors, illusionistic effects, a love of landscape, and a strong sense of visual narrative. Manuscripts produced by this circle of artists are renowned for their border decoration featuring a rich variety of realistically painted flowers, scrolling acanthus leaves, birds, and butterflies.",

The realistically carved mourners remain the most famous elements from Philip the Bold’s tomb. Carved by Claus de Werve, no two are alike.

The various floral elements represent love and fertility, while the colors of their clothes suggest not only their relationship but also chastity, love, and modesty. What details might you choose to symbolize a young couple in love?",
      "wall_description": "This beautiful painting depicts two lovers of aristocratic rank enjoying a chaste embrace. The painting includes abundant symbolism in the flowers and colors. Their rings and the circlets crowning their heads indicate that they are newlyweds; the blossoming bower surrounding them promises their union’s fertility. The young man presents a flower to his bride thought to be forget-me-not, a symbol of remembrance. The brightly colored costumes of both the man and woman are an indication of wealth and the latest fashion. The colors of both costumes visually suggest that the couple belongs to each other. The colors of green, red, and brown respectively suggest chastity, love, and modesty. Though represented at the peak of their youth and health, this panel was once joined to another called the Rotting Pair (Strasbourg, Musée de l’Oeuvre Notre-Dame), in which the young couple transforms into a pair of hideous corpses. Together the ensemble constituted a memento mori, a macabre reminder of the vanity of all things in the face of death.",

However, when his father's tomb was finally installed at the Chartreuse de Champmol in 1410, John expressed his wish to be interred there in a similar tombstone. Before any work could begin, John was murdered in 1419. It was not until 1443 that John's only legitimate son, Philip the Good, commissioned Jean de La Huerta to construct the tomb, modified to include an effigy of the Duke's wife Margaret of Bavaria who died in 1423. Following the wishes of both John the Fearless and Philip the Good, de la Huerta's design is only a slightly more elaborate version of Claus Sluter's tomb for Philip the Bold. De la Huerta worked on the tomb consistently for about two years; the rest was completed by Antoine Le Moiturier. The tomb was installed at Champmol in 1470. After its completion no further tombs of comparable magnificence were built for the Valois dukes in Burgundy.",

          "biography": "Camille Corot's earlier biographers presented him as a naive artist separated from commercial concerns who painted whatever pleased him in the French countryside and from his own emotions. For these writers his importance lay in his loosely painted, atmospheric landscapes, for which later modernists called him the precursor to impressionism. This conception of the artist has undergone significant revision with recent scholarship. Corot never seemed to accept the impressionists' more radical work, especially their enthusiasm for contemporary urban and suburban themes. He represented timeless, rural views disconnected from the industrialization and modernization of nineteenth-century France.\r\nFollowing his father in the clothing trade, Corot worked for eight years before the death of his younger sister in 1821 provided him with the additional income (her annual allowance) to enable him to devote himself to painting. In 1822 he began to study with the landscape painter Achille-Etna Michallon (1796-1822), winner of the first Grand Prix de Rome in historicized landscape, and after Michallon's early death that year, with Bertin (q.v.). Both Michallon and Bertin had trained with Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes (1750-1819), whose later eighteenth-century treatise on landscape painting practice urged artists to study nature closely. In addition, Michallon frequented the village of Barbizon and the forest of Fontainebleau, which would become important subjects for Corot and the group of painters known as the Barbizon school.\r\nIn 1825 Corot made his first trip to Italy, following in the tradition of the French academy but also the independent precedent of the seventeenth-century French painter Claude Lorrain. There Corot joined an international circle of artists, including Léopold Robert (1794-1835) and Aligny (q.v.), who struggled to resolve the contradictory phases of empirical study out of doors and synthetic recreation in the studio. From Rome, he sent his first submissions to the Paris Salon in 1827, among them The View at Narni (National Gallery of Canada, Ottowa). These early Italian views generally feature a bright, warm light with few areas in shadow.\r\nCorot gradually shifted from this early style to one in the 1840s that frequently included larger figures in the middle ground, more complex light effects, and a duller, earthy palette of greens and browns. He continued to use his outdoor works as models for finished canvases but freely adapted the compositions, forms, lighting, and color. The question of finish did not only pertain to the relationship between plein-air studies and studio compositions, which he called paysage composé (invented landscape). Corot sometimes added figures to landscapes that he had painted years earlier and even asked fellow painters such as Diaz de la Peña (q.v.) to paint them. His titles often referred to the geographical location that inspired the image, and some included the word souvenir (broad-ly translated as memory), which suggests recreating or revisiting some experience. \r\nThe critical reception of Corot's work fluctuated. His first Salon submissions passed the jury, but during the 1830s he was first overlooked and then attacked by the critics. By the 1840s his fortunes had improved, and he even sold one Salon picture to the French state. In more radical circles, the critic-poet Charles Baudelaire held Corot up as a leader in contemporary landscape painting. Corot received the Legion of Honor in 1846 as well as a municipal commission to decorate the baptismal fonts in the church of St. Nicolas du Chardonnet in Paris. \r\nIn the early 1850s Corot transformed his style again. He developed silvery tones and diffuse lighting effects applied in a few thin layers, over which he added small touches of brighter color for highlights. The soft glimmer and evocative atmosphere of these later works earned him commercial and critical success. During the last decade, Corot turned toward the single figure as subject. The meditative poses and expressions of these figures reminded some contemporary critics of seventeenth-century painting, especially the realism of Spanish and Dutch pictures. But Corot's landscapes remained his most admired work, and during his lifetime imitations or fakes were sold under his name.",

The Trinity is represented here in a composition known as the “New Testament Trinity,” which features Christ and God the Father seated on a bench with a dove representing the Holy Spirit between them. The central field is occupied by a large wooden throne with gold highlights on which Christ (left) and the Ancient of the Days (God the Father as Christ in old age) are seated. The Holy Spirit, in the form of a dove, hovers within an eight-pointed star that signifies the eighth day, the future eon.<br><br>On either side of the Trinity are two hymnographers, authors of hymns of praise, both identified by gold letters outlined in red—Saint Kosmas (about 675–752) on the left and Saint Joseph (about 812/818–about 886) on the right. They both suspend scrolls from round-arched windows. The icon likely was part of a church templon, the barrier that separated the nave from the sanctuary in an Orthodox church. It is not signed or dated; however, careful analysis of the painting’s style and technique places it in Constantinople around 1450, just prior to the city’s fall to the Ottomans in 1453. It represents a moment when Byzantine painting reached a brilliant crescendo.",

The realistically carved mourners remain the most famous elements from Philip the Bold’s tomb. Carved by Claus de Werve, no two are alike. They retain minute details of costume and features, and the faces of some are nearly portrait-like in their depiction of facial creases and expression, suggesting actual individuals, while the faces of others are partly obscured by their cowls.",

In 1948 the collection was inventoried, and it remained at the Kunstmuseum Basel until 1954 under the supervision of the museum’s director, Georg Schmidt. From 1954, Kirchner’s works were in the care of the estate administrator, Roman Norbert Ketterer, appointed by Kirchner’s heirs, who sold the CMA picture to Galerie Grosshennig on February 14, 1957."

The Kirchner is also recorded in the Otto Gerson stock books by June 1958 (stock no. P47), and in the gallery inventory by October 31 of that year. Neither the stock book nor the inventory clarify the circumstances of the transfer of the painting from Grosshennig to Gerson. Because Wilhelm Grosshennig and the Gerson Gallery worked very closely together throughout the 1950s and 1960s, it is quite possible the painting was under joint ownership."

Focusing on the psychology of modern life, he began painting street scenes, cabarets, and circus performers. He enhanced this painting's deliberately crude appearance by painting on coarse canvas and leaving the surface unvarnished. Despite serving in the German army during World War I, Kirchner became a principal target of the Nazis' systematic assault against so-called degenerate art.",

Unlike many Dutch painters of the period, Hals favored strong, visible brushstrokes that convey the vitality of his sitters. Roosterman strikes a confident pose, his costume sober but luxurious: his sleeves are decorated with braid and buttons, and ribbon rosettes encircle the waist of his doublet. The rich black of his suit is offset by the broad linen collar and lace-edged cuffs—fashionable details befitting a successful cloth merchant.",

In a composition borrowed from imperial Byzantine art, Mary is shown seated on a jeweled throne with the Christ child and flanked by archangels Michael and Gabriel. Above, Christ appears in a radiant light supported by two angels. Portraits of the apostles, identified in Greek, appear in the surrounding wreath symbolizing eternal life. This portable sacred textile was presumably displayed at the front of a public or private place of worship. This unique tapestry is one of the earliest Christian icons to survive. Woven icons were among the miraculous works shown to pilgrims in Jerusalem according to Abbot Adomnan of Iona (about 624–704) who described a linen cloth \"said to have been woven by Saint Mary, and is for this reason preserved in a church and venerated by the whole population. Pictures of the twelve apostles are woven into it, and there is also a portrait of the Lord.\" The abbot’s description of the woven icon suggests it must have been similar to the tapestry displayed here. The delicate effects of shading in the facial features, garments, and vegetation were achieved by weaving the panel sideways with at least 20 colors, just as medieval tapestry weavers did centuries later in Europe. The high cost of dyes caused this majestic icon to be far costlier than painted images.",

The figure originally held a spear in one hand; by removing the weapon, Rodin stripped the sculpture of narrative symbols and focused on the sensuality and psychological power of the male nude. Contemporaries found the figure so realistic they falsely accused Rodin of making a cast from a living person. Museum trustee Ralph King commissioned this cast from the artist in 1916 with the intention of donating it to the museum. Rodin personally supervised the exceptionally fine casting and finished it with his favorite patina, a deep reddish tone he called “crushed grape.”",

This type of ware was produced no later than 1330s for both domestic use (the court and common people alike) and overseas trade. This example testifies to the transmission of artistic ideas and techniques between China and the rest of the great Mongol Empire as a result of trade. The cobalt that was used as blue colorant for underglaze decoration was imported from Iran, likely from Kashan. The band of cloud-collar motifs with phoenixes set against floral grounds, as shown here, is an artistic vocabulary that can also be found in Iranian decorative arts of the Ilkhanid period (1256-1353).",

      "wall_description": "The Luba kingdom flourished from about the 17th century to the late 19th century. The best-known Luba object types relate to ideas of kingship and the kingdom's ceremonial and ritual life. Staffs are among the most important Luba regalia. During the investiture ritual, the new ruler holds the staff when he swears his oath of office. Aside from being a symbol of rank and high office, a staff also serves as a historical document and archive that can be \"read\" like a sculptural map, memorializing important events, places, and people. The rendering of women points to their political and religious significance in history and society; although Luba rulers were always male, their mothers, wives, and sisters acted as advisors and diplomats behind the scenes. On this particular staff, the Janus heads and female figures probably represent one of the many Luba tutelary spirit pairs. The metal point alludes to the kingdom's stability and durability.<br><br>Despite the fact that Luba staffs encompass many different substyles, this is undoubtedly one of the most impressive examples of Luba art. Elaborately carves staffs similar to this one are quite rare. In the United States, there are only a small number of staffs in private collections and museums.",

II, p. 102), in the collection of Alexander Baring and formerly with Joseph Bonaparte. Both the provenance and the description of this painting make it clear, however, that it is not the CMA painting.  Furthermore, several sources state that Thomas George Baring inherited the painting from his uncle: the Baring genealogy (http://www.baringarchive.org.uk/barings_people/baring_family_genealogy/) shows that his uncle was Thomas Baring, not Alexander. Thus, it can be concluded that the CMA painting was not in Alexander’s collection (by 1854 or otherwise), but rather was sold by Nieuwenhuys to Thomas Baring."

However, it seems probable that \"Birch\" is in fact \"Bryan,\" and perhaps the result of a misreading of the handwritten notation in the 1802 sale catalogue. If Bryan was indeed the consignor, this would account for the small provenance gap from 1802-1803, and would, of course, make sense chronologically, given that Bryan purchased the painting at the 1802 sale. Evidence situating the <em>Sabine Women</em> in Bryan's possession prior to 1803 would provide confirmation that \"Birch\" is in fact \"Bryan,\" and that the former was an error on the part of the author of the catalogue notation. Of course, it is also possible that after purchasing the painting from Christie's in 1802, Bryan transferred the painting to Birch, who then put it up for auction at the 1803 Greenwood sale."

Diana lived apart from men, accompanied by a group of nymphs; she often represented unattainable beauty or chastity. With a nymph at left fending off a lustful satyr, Rubens refers to a struggle between vice and virtue, combining a sensual display of female bodies with a moral undertone. To bring the viewer more fully into the narrative, Rubens pulls the full-bodied figures to the front of the picture plane, and Diana steps forward, activating the space between viewer and subject. The nymph at the right has the features of Isabella Brant, the artist’s wife, and can be compared with Rubens’s portrait of her, also in the museum's collection.",

      "wall_description": "Large painted crucifixes dating from the 1100s and 1200s are among the earliest surviving Italian panel paintings. Large crosses, like this beautiful example, were typically suspended high above an altar in the main apse of Italian churches. Smaller crosses were placed on or just above altars in small side chapels. Such crosses served as the visual focus for devotion and symbolized the Eucharistic sacrament performed by the priest on the altar below. This crucifix shows Christ alive on the cross as the triumphant savior of mankind. Smaller images on the \"apron\" represent images of Christ's Passion (to the left) and his death and Resurrection (to the right). On the far left terminal appear the mourning Virgin and Saint John the Evangelist, while on the right the viewer is shown Saint James Major and Saint Bona, patroness of the city of Pisa. The concluding event, the Ascension of Christ, once appeared on the upper terminal, just above the Virgin and Apostles. The figure of Christ is painted in a severe and hieratic style suggestive of medieval Pisa's artistic and commercial links with the Byzantine East. The appearance of Saint Bona on this cross may suggest that it was made for the Church of S. Martino in Pisa, where Franciscan nuns tended the holy woman's relics.",

          "biography": "Pierre Bonnard was a law student when he began his artistic training in 1887 at the Académie Julian in Paris, where he met Paul Sérusier (1864-1927) and the theorist and painter Maurice Denis (1870-1943). Both would be influential in his artistic career and become Bonnard's lifelong friends. In 1889, the year he obtained his law degree, he saw the exhibition at Café Volpini (see Gauguin, Woman in the Waves, no. 100) and was particularly impressed with Gauguin's work. Sérusier, after having returned from studying with Gauguin in Pont-Aven, decided to form his own artistic group called the Nabis (Hebrew: prophets). The founding members of the Nabis included Denis, who wrote the manifesto for the group, \"Définition du néo-traditionnisme\" (published in May 1890 in Art et critique), Bonnard, Paul Ranson (1864-1909), and Henri-Gabriel Ibels (1867-1936). Their first exhibition occurred in 1891, and they were later joined by Ker-Xavier Roussel (1867-1944) and Vuillard (q.v.). Based loosely on the synthetist goals established by Gauguin and Émile Bernard, the movement was created from Sérusier's vision of an artistic brotherhood dedicated to symbolism whereby a universal language could be expressed through symbols. The Nabis were opposed to the naturalism taught at academies by artists such as Bouguereau (q.v.) and wanted to move away from didactic and moral paintings toward a more decorative style characterized by simplified drawing, flat patches of color, and heavy set contours. Bonnard's works of the 1890s were influenced by the innovations of Gauguin as well as Japanese prints, which were easily accessible in nineteenth-century Paris. His paintings took on a decorative quality, mirroring his artistic expressions in other media such as stained glass, furniture, pottery, and painted screens. Bonnard's and Vuillard's domestic interior paintings of the 1890s were often described using the term intimisme. In 1891 Bonnard also experimented with other media, including poster designs and lithographs, which inspired his friend Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864-1901), whom he had met through La revue blanche, a magazine that published the Nabis' work. Around 1900 the members of the Nabis began to drift apart. Between 1905 and 1910 Bonnard and Vuillard traveled to England, Belgium, Holland, Spain, and Italy, visiting many museums. Bonnard's art began to gravitate toward impressionism, but his colors were more expressive and his compositions more overtly structured; elements of the painted interiors such as doors, windows or pieces of furniture often provided a strong compositional framework. He also worked extensively with photographs. His late works were acclaimed by fellow Parisians like Henri Matisse (1869-1954) and Paul Signac (1863-1935). After 1920 Bonnard exhibited extensively and became an internationally renowned artist, receiving much recognition in the United States, where he traveled in 1926.",

Oliviero Caraffa, Cardinal of Naples, commissioned this work, although Lippi probably painted it in Rome while working for the cardinal’s family, an example of the widespread taste across Italy for the art of Florence. Meticulously detailed still-life elements on the parapet, thick with symbolic meaning, reflect Lippi’s interest in northern European painting he would have seen in Florence. Likewise the classical architecture—referring to the pagan world cast off by Christianity—demonstrates his engagement with ancient art and architecture in Rome. Embellished with learned references and made with expensive materials, this painting would have actively inspired religious meditation and demonstrated the patrons’ courtly, civilized taste.",

A son of Zeus who helped to defend Troy from invading Greek forces, \"godlike Sarpedon of the brazen helmet\" fell at the hands of Patroclus, as told by Homer in Book XVI of the <em>Iliad</em>. Apollo then intervened to protect the body, removing it from danger and entrusting it to the two winged deities, as depicted here and in a number of other ancient artworks, Greek and Etruscan alike. If not Sarpedon, the fallen warrior could be Memnon, the son of Eos and Tithonos slain by Achilles.",
      "wall_description": "The Etruscans, a mysterious people who lived in northern Italy, loved Greek mythology and used it as subject matter in their works of art. The two winged figures, Sleep and Death, bend respectfully and tenderly toward their burden—Zeus's son, \"godlike Sarpedon of the brazen helmet,\" who died on the battlefield at Troy. According to Homer's <em>Iliad</em>, the young prince had led a band of warriors from Lycia (in southern Turkey) to help King Priam repulse the Greek attack. Apollo, at Zeus's request, sent his winged messengers to gather the limp body, bathe and anoint it, and carry it home for burial. This bronze was once the handle of a large jewelry box called a <em>cista</em>.",

          "biography": "Anselm Kiefer German, 1945-\r\n\r\nOne of the most significant and reclusive artists of the past 20 years, Anselm Kiefer was born in Donaueschingen, Bavaria, two months before the end of World War II. His enormous mixed-media canvases, as well as his smaller bookworks, are laden with cultural, political, mythic, and religious symbolism. These works are made in direct response to his Teutonic heritage and, in particular, Germany's war experience. Kiefer addresses questions regarding German identity in the postwar world, a highly sensitive subject that has brought him both critical acclaim and adamant opposition.\r\n\tKiefer studied law and French at the University of Freiburg in 1965 before turning to painting. He graduated in 1970 and began informal study at the Staatliche Kunstakademie in Düsseldorf with Joseph Beuys, who encouraged him to paint despite dominance of conceptual art at the time and the declaration that painting was dead. Kiefer often spends years on a piece, working intermittently, and retains rigid control of the placement of his paintings after they leave his studio.\r\n\tAlthough Kiefer's work has changed little throughout his career, his earlier imagery relied on figurative elements and his later paintings have become more abstract, often incorporating architectural elements. He frequently begins with an enlarged photographic image, which he distorts by such techniques as scorching, staining, and burning. His materials include molten lead, tar, straw, and clay, metaphorical substances associated with the German land and its mythologies. The transformative process also recalls alchemy, a subject that interested Beuys, who believed art had the power to evoke a change of state from physical to spiritual.\r\n\tKiefer has had numerous international exhibitions and published monographs, and is represented in major American and European collections. In addition to one-person exhibitions in Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, France, Israel, and England, the Philadelphia Museum of Art organized a retrospective of his work that toured the United States in 1987-88. In recent years, Kiefer has begun to make films that, rooted in the medium of photography, extend the physical and narrative qualities characteristic of all his work into the realms of motion and time. He lives in Barjac, France. A.W.",

Émile Zola, the future author, was to become one of his closest friends. Cézanne enrolled at the École Gratuite de Dessin in 1857, entering the studio of Joseph Gibert (1806-1884). Two years later, complying with his father's wishes, he began studying law at the Université d'Aix while still at the École Gratuite de Dessin. In 1861 Cézanne finally left law school and followed Zola to Paris where he met Pissarro (q.v.) at the Académie Suisse. Probably after his failure to enter the École des Beaux-Arts, he returned to Aix and began working at his father's bank. In 1862, however, Cézanne returned to Paris, where he studied at the Académie Suisse and copied the works of the Old Masters in the Louvre. The works he produced during this period reflect the influence of Spanish painters such as Ribera (1591-1562) and Zurbarán (1598-1664), and other predecessors such as Delacroix (q.v.). His submissions to the Salons of 1865 through 1870 (and even through 1881) did not receive the jury's approval; the reinstatement of the Salon des Refusés was repeatedly but unsuccessfully demanded. Cézanne traveled often between Aix and Paris until 1870. To escape the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71) he stayed in the south in L'Estaque, along with his mistress, Hortense Fiquet, whom he had met in 1869. Cézanne moved back north to Pontoise with Hortense and his son, Paul, in 1872 and worked with Pissarro and met Dr. Paul Gachet. The following year he moved again to nearby Auvers-sur-Oise with his family, continuing his work with Pissarro. In 1874 and 1877 Cézanne participated in the first and third impressionist exhibitions, but the severe criticism of his works led him to abstain from using this venue again. In 1878 his father learned of the existence of Hortense and Paul, who at that point were living in Marseille, and threatened to discontinue his allowance. While in the Midi, Cézanne often worked with Monticelli (q.v.). His art increasingly matured, and he began concentrating on the order and internal structure within his compositions, limiting his palette. During these years he also met Gauguin (q.v.) and Renoir (q.v.), and always trav-eled, chiefly between Aix and L'Estaque. In 1886 Cézanne married Hortense, his father died, and the inheritance provided him with the financial means to live without constraints. He bought a house in Marlotte near Fontainebleau in 1892. In 1895 he had his first solo show at the gallery of Ambroise Vollard, who two years later bought all the artist's works from his studio near Corbeil. The dealer Paul Durand-Ruel became another important client. Cézanne participated in the Salon des Indépendants in 1899, 1901, and 1902 and exhibited at La Libre Esthétique in Brussels in 1901 and 1904, the Secession in Vienna in 1903, and the Salon d'Automne in 1904-6. He continued to study the underlying structure of nature, at times approaching abstraction by denying traditional perspective and using multiple viewpoints. He also began leaving portions of the canvas bare, giving some works an unfinished appearance. Cézanne's work had a tremendous influence on the artists of his time as well as those of subsequent generations, and he is considered one of the most influential figures in the development of modern art.",

Elaborate displays of abundance were reflected in the carvings of flora, fauna, and freshly hunted game. The depictions of Native American hunters on this example, most likely made in Philadelphia, may have meant that this piece was displayed at one of the many international expositions that occurred during this period.",

          "biography": "The son of a clergyman, Vincent van Gogh was sent to The Hague at the age of sixteen to become an apprentice at Goupil &amp; Co., an art dealer with whom his uncle was affiliated. In August 1872 van Gogh began his extensive correspondence with his younger brother Theo, who would join the Brussels branch of the firm the following year. Vincent was transferred to the London offices in 1873 and two years later to the Paris office, but he despised the art trade and was dismissed in 1876. He then taught briefly at a boarding school in Ramsgate and Isleworth, and, back in the Netherlands, worked in a bookshop in Dordrecht before moving to Amsterdam to study theology. In little more than a year he had left the university and entered missionary school, failing again. Still intent on entering the ministry, he moved to the Borinage in Belgium and became a lay evangelist to the miners. Van Gogh finally decided to become an artist in August 1880 and started copying works by Millet (q.v.), the painter of peasant life. With his brother's financial help, he briefly joined the Academy in Brussels. The following year he returned to The Hague, where he received some artistic training from his cousin by marriage, Anton Mauve (1838-1888). There van Gogh met Sien Hoornik, a pregnant prostitute with a five-year-old daughter, with whom he lived briefly. Unable to marry her because of his family's disapproval, he moved in November 1883 from The Hague to the province of Drenthe, a popular place for artists, where he painted and drew laborers and peasants. Feeling terribly lonely, he visited his parents in December 1884 in Nuenen, and it was there that he finally decided to become a painter of peasant life. Van Gogh completed The Potato Eaters (Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam) in April 1885 and sent it to his brother in Paris. On 25 November he moved to Antwerp, where he reveled in the work of Rubens and first came to know Japanese prints. Van Gogh traveled to Paris in March 1886 and lived with Theo. Under the influence of the impressionists, and works by Monticelli (q.v.), his palette changed to more intense and vibrant colors. He began to associate with Émile Bernard (1868-1941), Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864-1901), Degas (q.v.), Gauguin (q.v.), Pissarro (q.v.), and Seurat (q.v.) and started collecting some of their paintings as well as Japanese prints. He moved to Arles in February 1888. Apart from paintings, he also made some drawings because it was a cheaper medium. Theo encouraged him to submit to the Salon des Indépendants. In May Vincent rented a room in the Yellow House, even though he could hardly afford to do so, and continued to send his work to his brother. In June he became intrigued with the subject of the wheat harvest and painted The Sower (Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo). On 23 October 1888, Gauguin arrived in Arles, at a time when van Gogh was having trouble with his eyesight. Gauguin encouraged him to paint from memory, which resulted in Memory of the Garden in Etten (Hermitage, St. Petersburg). The artists, however, had many disagreements, and during a dramatic quarrel on 23 December van Gogh mutilated his ear. He was taken into a hospital in Arles, and Gauguin left for Paris. Van Gogh recovered rapidly and was dismissed on 7 January 1889. In February his neighbors objected to his presence in the Yellow House, and he had to return to the hospital. In April Theo married Johanna Gesina Bonger, who would eventually safeguard most of Vincent's oeuvre. Aware of his mental problems, at the end of April van Gogh checked himself into the asylum of Saint-Paul-de-Mausole in Saint-Rémy, where he was treated by Dr. Peyron. His condition was stable, and he was allowed to work in a makeshift studio. He worked in the garden (Irises, J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles) and painted the fields he could see from his window. Under supervision he painted in the countryside, rendering cypresses and olive trees. Starry Night (Museum of Modern Art, New York) also stems from this period. From July through September he suffered from a severe depression that prevented him from working. He resumed his work from October through December, painting well-known Provençal works and adapting prints after Delacroix (q.v.), Millet, and Rembrandt (1606-1669). In January 1890 he exhibited five works with Les XX in Brussels, selling one of them. After a visit to Arles at the end of February, he became ill again but continued to work. He finally left the asylum, and visited Theo in Paris on his way to Auvers, where he arrived on 20 May. He became close friends with Dr. Gachet and rented a room at the inn of the Ravoux family. He painted the village, portraits, and the surrounding wheat fields. On 27 July 1890, during an episode of depression, van Gogh shot himself in the chest and died two days later.",

Historical figures of royal and imperial rank are depicted with Christ, the Virgin, apostles, and archangels along the altar’s sides, stressing the countess’s political ambitions and claim of imperial lineage for her own dynasty. The Latin inscription surrounding the altar stone reads, \"Gertrude offers to Christ, to live joyfully in him, this stone that glistens with gems and gold.\"",

When Assur, the lord who called me by name (and) made my sovereignty supreme, placed his merciless weapon in my lordly arms, the extensive troops of the Lullumu I felled in battle. With the help of the Šamaš and Adad, the gods my supporters, the troops of the lands Nairi, the land Ḫabḫu, the land Šubaru, and the land Nibur, like Adad the devastator, I thundered over them. The king who subdued (the territory stretching) from the opposite bank of the Tigris to Mount Lebanon and the Great Sea, the entire land Laqu (and) the land Suḫu including the city Rapiqu. He conquered from the source of the river Subnat to the land Urartu. (The territory stretching) from the passes of mount Kirruri to the land Gilzanu, from the opposite bank of the Lower Zab  to the city Til Bari which is upstream from the land Zaban, from the city Til-ša-Abtāni to the city Til-ša-Zabdāni, the cities of Ḫirimu, Ḫarutu, (which are) fortresses of Karduniaš, I brought (those lands) within the boundaries of my land. I accounted (the people) from the passes of Mount Babitu to Mount Ḫaszmar as people of my land. In the lands over which I gained dominion I always appointed my governors. They entered servitude. Assurnasirpal (II), attentive prince, worshipper of the great gods, ferocious dragon, conqueror of cities and the entire highlands, king of lords, encircle  of the obstinate, crowned with splendor, fearless in battle, merciless hero, he who stirs up strife, praiseworthy king, shepherd, protection of the (four) quarters, the king whose command disintegrates mountains and seas, the one who by his lordly conflict has brought under one authority ferocious (and) merciless kings from east to west: The city of Kalḫu of old, which Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, a prince who preceded me, had built—this city had become dilapidated, it lay dormant. I took people which I had conquered from the lands over which I gained dominion, from the land Suḫu, (from) the entire land of Laqu, (from) the city Sirqu which is at the crossing of the Euphrates, (from) the entire land of Zamua, from Bit-Adini, and the land Ḫatti and from Lubarna, the Patinu. I settled them therein. I cleared away the old ruin hill (and) dug down to water level. Down to a depth of 120 layers of brick I sank (the foundation pit). A palace of cedar, cypress, daprānu-juniper, boxwood, meskannu-wood, terebinth, and tamarisk, as my royal residence (and) for my lordly leisure for eternity, I founded (it) therein. Beasts of mountains and seas in white limestone and parutu (-alabaster), I made (replicas of them) (and) stationed (them) at their doors. I decorated it in a splendid fashion; I surrounded it with knobbed nails of bronze. Doors of cedar, cypress, daprāni-juniper, (and) meskannu-wood, I hung in its doorways. Silver, gold, tin, bronze, iron, booty from the lands over which I gained dominion, I took in great quantities and put therein.",

In 879 bc the Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal II began building his new royal residence at Nimrud. Originally brightly painted, this is one of some 300 reliefs that decorated the palace. Masterfully executed with incised details and exaggerated musculature, this giant, fierce, protective spirit raises his right hand in a ritual salute. His left hand grasps a branch bearing rosettes, perhaps a stylized date palm. Across the center of the relief are inscribed lines of Akkadian cuneiform recounting military victories, conquests, plundered loot, and the reconstruction of the city. Destroyed in 612 bc, the palace lay buried for 24 centuries until rediscovered in 1845.",

          "biography": "The son of a wealthy banker, Cézanne began his studies in Aix-en-Provence at the École Saint-Joseph in 1849, then attended the Collège Bourbon from 1852 until 1858. Émile Zola, the future author, was to become one of his closest friends. Cézanne enrolled at the École Gratuite de Dessin in 1857, entering the studio of Joseph Gibert (1806-1884). Two years later, complying with his father's wishes, he began studying law at the Université d'Aix while still at the École Gratuite de Dessin. In 1861 Cézanne finally left law school and followed Zola to Paris where he met Pissarro (q.v.) at the Académie Suisse. Probably after his failure to enter the École des Beaux-Arts, he returned to Aix and began working at his father's bank. In 1862, however, Cézanne returned to Paris, where he studied at the Académie Suisse and copied the works of the Old Masters in the Louvre. The works he produced during this period reflect the influence of Spanish painters such as Ribera (1591-1562) and Zurbarán (1598-1664), and other predecessors such as Delacroix (q.v.). His submissions to the Salons of 1865 through 1870 (and even through 1881) did not receive the jury's approval; the reinstatement of the Salon des Refusés was repeatedly but unsuccessfully demanded. Cézanne traveled often between Aix and Paris until 1870. To escape the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71) he stayed in the south in L'Estaque, along with his mistress, Hortense Fiquet, whom he had met in 1869. Cézanne moved back north to Pontoise with Hortense and his son, Paul, in 1872 and worked with Pissarro and met Dr. Paul Gachet. The following year he moved again to nearby Auvers-sur-Oise with his family, continuing his work with Pissarro. In 1874 and 1877 Cézanne participated in the first and third impressionist exhibitions, but the severe criticism of his works led him to abstain from using this venue again. In 1878 his father learned of the existence of Hortense and Paul, who at that point were living in Marseille, and threatened to discontinue his allowance. While in the Midi, Cézanne often worked with Monticelli (q.v.). His art increasingly matured, and he began concentrating on the order and internal structure within his compositions, limiting his palette. During these years he also met Gauguin (q.v.) and Renoir (q.v.), and always trav-eled, chiefly between Aix and L'Estaque. In 1886 Cézanne married Hortense, his father died, and the inheritance provided him with the financial means to live without constraints. He bought a house in Marlotte near Fontainebleau in 1892. In 1895 he had his first solo show at the gallery of Ambroise Vollard, who two years later bought all the artist's works from his studio near Corbeil. The dealer Paul Durand-Ruel became another important client. Cézanne participated in the Salon des Indépendants in 1899, 1901, and 1902 and exhibited at La Libre Esthétique in Brussels in 1901 and 1904, the Secession in Vienna in 1903, and the Salon d'Automne in 1904-6. He continued to study the underlying structure of nature, at times approaching abstraction by denying traditional perspective and using multiple viewpoints. He also began leaving portions of the canvas bare, giving some works an unfinished appearance. Cézanne's work had a tremendous influence on the artists of his time as well as those of subsequent generations, and he is considered one of the most influential figures in the development of modern art.",

Verses from the holy Qur’an, written in a form of Arabic script called <em>thuluth,</em> surround the mihrab. The inscription is rendered with white glaze, while the continuous arabesque vine behind the Qur’anic text is executed in gold, turquoise, and green—the color of the Prophet Muhammad and of paradise.<br> <br> The inscription is from the Chapter of Light (<em>Surah An-Nur</em>): “Allah is the light of the Heavens and the Earth. His Light is like a niche in which is a lamp—the lamp enclosed in glass—the glass, as it were, a glistening star; lit from a blessed olive tree, neither of the East nor of the West, whose oil would almost glow, even though fire touched it not. Light upon light! Allah guides whom He will to His light, and Allah sets forth parables for men, and Allah knows all things.” The artistic and calligraphic styles suggest this mihrab was made about 1500, but the physical appearance of the ceramic mosaic pieces does not. The glaze colors are too consistent, and they have not discolored from moisture seeping behind the cut tile edges. Clay substrates of the tiles were tested in 2001 using thermoluminescence to determine the date the tiles were fired. The results indicated that the tiles were modern, made between 1941 and 1961, and they are under further examination.",

          "biography": "Renoir's parents, a tailor and a dressmaker, moved their family to Paris in 1844. At age thirteen Renoir apprenticed with the porcelain decorators Levy Frères & Cie. He earned money by painting fans, blinds, and murals for cafés. In 1860 he registered to copy Old Master paintings in the Louvre and, the following year, entered the studio of Charles Gleyre (1806-1874), where he met Frédéric Bazille (1841-1870), Monet (q.v.), and Sisley (q.v.). In 1862 he was also accepted at the École des Beaux-Arts. With his friends from Gleyre's studio, he began working en plein air and, during a visit to the forest of Fontainebleau, was introduced to Diaz de la Peña (q.v.). After a failed attempt in 1863, Renoir's first painting was accepted at the Salon of 1864, the same year he painted Cleveland's portrait of Romaine Lacaux. More typical of this early period, however, is the painting Diana the Huntress (1867, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.), which reveals Courbet's (q.v.) influence. Around 1867 Renoir shared a studio with Bazille and Monet, the latter becoming an important influence on his art. Renoir and Monet's comparable impressionist style during this period is evident in two paintings each made at La grenouillère (all four titled La grenouillère, 1869: Nationalmuseum, Stockholm, and Pushkin Museum, Moscow [Renoir]; National Gallery, London, and Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [Monet]),1 a bathing establishment on the Seine. After Renoir's military service during the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71), Monet introduced him to the dealer Durand-Ruel, who began purchasing his works. Renoir's submissions to the Salon were regularly refused, which encouraged him to participate in the first impressionist exhibition in 1874 and the 1875 auction at Hôtel Drouot, where his works were ridiculed by the critics. At the third impressionist exhibition in 1877, he showed Ball at the Moulin de la Galette (1876, Musée d'Orsay, Paris), in which he addressed a subject of modern life, one of his most characteristic impressionist paintings on a grand scale, with a rich pattern of light and shadow. In 1878 he returned to the Salon and became quite successful, establishing his reputation as a portraitist (1878, Mme Charpentier and her Children, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). He continued to use this official venue for the next several years, declining to exhibit with the impressionists. This decision was partly generated by the fact that his newfound clientele would be more appreciative of his participating in the Salon. He was supported by his patrons, particularly the Charpentiers, owners of a publishing house, whose journal La vie moderne furthered Renoir's reputation. After a trip to North Africa and Italy in 1881, he joined Cézanne at L'Estaque. Throughout the 1880s and 1890s Renoir traveled extensively through Brittany, Normandy, Provence, and Spain. In the mid-1880s he began to experiment with more linear contours, the application of thinner paint layers, and smoother brush strokes. This so-called Ingresque period, which had a very mixed reception, lasted for about six years. He then reflected upon the achievements of the Old Masters and favored a more fluid style, after which he returned to using broader brush strokes and more vibrant colors. In 1886 he was given a one-man show by Durand-Ruel. By 1900 Renoir was an established artist: he became Chevalier of the Legion of Honor in 1900 and four years later was honored at the Salon d'Automne with a gallery devoted to his works. Beginning in 1912 he suffered from rheumatism and began using a wheelchair, yet he continued to work until the end of his life. He now often stayed in southern France, where he owned property in Cagnes-sur-Mer. Renoir regularly exhibited his works at the Durand-Ruel and Bernheim-Jeune galleries in Paris, as well as elsewhere in Europe and in the United States.",

The delicate nuances of color, particularly in the young girl's face, reveal Renoir's previous training as a decorator of porcelain.

          "biography": "Gauguin spent the first seven years of his life with his mother and great uncle in Peru. In 1855 his mother took him back to France where he attended boarding school. He joined the merchant marine when he was seventeen and began traveling around South America. When Gauguin's mother died in 1868, Gustave Arosa, an art collector and photographer, became his legal guardian. Arosa's collection included works by Corot (q.v.), Courbet (q.v.), Delacroix (q.v.), and the Barbizon painters, and it was he who would encourage Gauguin to start painting. In 1872 Arosa found a job for Gauguin at a brokerage firm, giving him financial security. The following year he married a Danish woman, Mette Gad. Gauguin had already started painting and sculpting in his spare time and first exhibited at the Salon in 1876 with a landscape.1 He was asked by Pissarro (q.v.) and Degas (q.v.) to participate in the fourth impressionist exhibition in 1879, where from then on he would exhibit regularly. Durand-Ruel began purchasing his paintings, and in turn Gauguin started to collect the works of his colleagues, such as Manet (q.v.) and Renoir (q.v.) and, in particular, Cézanne (q.v.) and Pissarro. He went to Pontoise in 1882, where he painted with Cézanne and Pissarro, who along with Degas continued to influence him at this period. In 1883 Gauguin decided to become a full-time artist. In 1884 he moved with his wife and children to Rouen and then to Copenhagen, but he failed to earn a comfortable living. He returned to Paris in 1886 and met ceramicist Ernest Chaplet (1835-1909), who introduced him to his métier. Gauguin distanced himself from impressionism and in 1888 worked in Pont-Aven with Émile Bernard (1868-1941), who had been experimenting with creating compositions using flat areas of color and dark outlines (cloissonism). Gauguin also studied Japanese prints and Indonesian art. The impact of these influences is evident in Gauguin's Vision after the Sermon: Jacob Wrestling with the Angel (1888, National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh), so far removed from his earlier impressionist style. Succumbing to van Gogh's (q.v.) many requests, Gauguin agreed to travel to Arles and paint with the artist; their characters, however, proved incompatible. Theo van Gogh, who worked for Boussod Valadon & Cie, would in the meantime sell Gauguin's work. For the next two years, Gauguin traveled often around Brittany. In search of a more pure and unspoiled culture, he auctioned off his paintings in 1891 in order to finance a journey to Tahiti. Upon his arrival, he was disappointed to find many expatriates and developed areas, yet he was still able to capture in his works an uncultivated spirit. He not only made paintings but also created bold woodcuts and sculptures and was an avid writer. Gauguin returned to France in 1893, where he was given a solo exhibition by Durand-Ruel that was not particularly successful. He decided to leave Europe again in 1895, moving to Tahiti and later to Hivaoa, a more remote island in the Marquesas. Because he abandoned naturalistic colors and used formal distortions in order to achieve expressive compositions, Gauguin's work became an inspiration for many subsequent artists. \r\n1.

Meissonnier embellished this tureen in a picturesque arrangement of vegetables and creatures, transforming a utilitarian object into a decadent display of wealth and abundance.

          "biography": "Joseph Mallord William Turner, the supreme landscape painter of the romantic era, had the exceptional good fortune to be the son of a Covent Garden barber and wigmaker who thoroughly supported his aspirations to paint pictures. As an adolescent, Turner colored engravings for the print sellers and apprenticed with architectural draftsman Thomas Malton (1726-1801). Although he entered the Royal Academy Schools in 1789, Turner's substantive artistic training came from his numerous self-conducted topographical drawing tours of the British Isles in the early 1790s and from his camaraderie with Thomas Girtin (1775-1802), with whom he copied the masterworks of landscape watercolorist John Robert Cozens (1752-1799) in the collection of Dr. Thomas Monro (1759-1833). Turner submitted his first oil painting, a seascape, for exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1796 and was elected an associate member three years later, at the earliest permissible age. Devoted to the academy's lofty mission, as it had been articulated by the recently deceased Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723-1792) in his annual lectures to the students of the academy, Turner would relish his election as a full academician in 1802 and would serve as professor of perspective from 1807 until 1837. His masterpieces of the early decades (and there seems an endless succession of works with title to that distinction) were either homages to past masters of landscape painting or entirely personal interpretations of the most extraordinary range of naturalistic effects and subjects. Whether it was The Fifth Plague of Egypt (1800, Indianapolis Museum of Art) and its amalgam of allusions to Nicolas Poussin (1594-1665) and Richard Wilson (1714-1782), The Dort Packet-Boat from Rotterdam Becalmed (1818, Yale Center for British Art, New Haven), with its overt tribute to Aelbert Cuyp (1620-1691), or The Fall of an Avalanche in the Grisons (1810, Tate Gallery, London), with its unprecedented invention of horrific naturalistic detail that challenged conventional notions of the sublime in art, the net effect of Turner's achievement was to elevate landscape painting to a status within the traditional hierarchy of genres that it had rarely enjoyed since the seventeenth century. Unlike Constable (q.v.), Turner was an indefatigable traveler abroad. His first visit to Switzerland in 1802 resulted in a spectacular series of exhibition watercolors that boldly established watercolor painting as a vital medium of original expression. A tour of Belgium, the Netherlands, and the Rhine in 1817 was followed by his first protracted stay in Italy in 1819. After 1820 summer excursions to France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and especially Venice were almost annual occurrences. Gradually, and primarily after the 1819 Italian sojourn, Turner's palette lightened. Traditional notions of chiaroscuro, of alternating bands of light and dark earth colors, yielded to compositions orchestrated in brighter hues, in which the various colors move across the painted surface almost at will, little respecting the forms they describe but in perfect balance.\r\nDuring the 1820s and early 1830s Turner committed vast amounts of his creative capital to the production of literary and travel illustrations. These kept an entire generation of engravers employed for several decades. Despite the tendency of his era to stigmatize reproductive engraving as an inferior instrument of artistic presentation, Turner was preoccupied with its processes and potential, acutely aware that, long after his pigments had faded, his reputation would be secure in the more durable brilliance of the engraver's deftly crafted reproductions. A second trip to Italy in 1828 may partially account for the heightened coloring of Ulysses Deriding Polyphemus (1828, National Gallery, London), which John Ruskin described as a pivotal picture in Turner's career. But there was very little falling off in either technical or thematic invention during the last decades of Turner's life. In major oils like Snow Storm-Steam Boat Off a Harbor's Mouth (1842, Tate Gallery, London) and Rain, Steam and Speed (1844, National Gallery, London) and no less measure in the series of elaborately finished Swiss watercolors executed on commission at the end of his life, natural forms occupy an uncertain place between concrete reality and total dissolution by light into the colors and images of what Monet (q.v.) admiringly called the \"exuberant romanticism of Turner's fancy.\" Perspective can be intentionally distorted and the color schemes can approach the brazenly artificial, yet somehow the fundamental truth of Turner's vision, his faith in the supreme forces of nature and in the artist's preeminence as the mediator of that experience, continues to persuade.",

Turner records the struggle as the boats in the lower-right corner head toward the flames. Although Turner based the painting on an actual event, he magnified the height of the flames, using the disaster as the starting point to express man’s helplessness when confronted with the destructive powers of nature. Brilliant swathes of color and variable atmospheric effects border on abstraction.",

It is made up of a series of silver plaques held together by gilt-silver borders. The plaques are engraved, and the resulting fine lines or depressions have been filled with a silver sulfide alloy, lustrous black in color, in a technique called niello. It is one of the finest examples of this decorative technique for which Florence was renowned in the 15th century. This cover and its manuscript once belonged to the French cardinal, Jean La Balou, who was jailed in 1469. He presented his gospel book to Pope Paul II as a gift, perhaps in the hope of receiving his freedom. The gospel book, of which its two covers have survived (the back cover is in the Minneapolis Institute of Arts), remained in the papal apartments until the end of the 18th century, perhaps leaving when Napoleon’s troops held the Vatican.",

      "wall_description": "O'Keeffe is best known for close-up flower subjects whose magnified forms fill the entire space of each canvas. Likely inspired by similar compositions in modern photography, these images are not only celebrations of nature, but also striking essays in abstract design. Although many critics interpreted O'Keeffe's flower paintings as reflections of femininity in general and female sexuality in particular, the artist strongly opposed such readings. Throughout most of her career, she frequently attempted to persuade others to discuss her work without referring to her gender, writing on one occasion, \"I have always been very annoyed at being referred to as a 'woman artist' rather than an 'artist.'\"",

The marten skin attached to the woman’s waist-its head decorated with gems-symbolized propriety. These expressions of wealth convey achievements and position rather than accurate personalities, and the figures, though lifelike, stand in awkward relationship to each other, their interaction one of alliance not love.",

      "wall_description": "The coffin of Bakenmut is one of the finest examples of painted wooden coffins made for the priests of Amen and their families at Thebes during Dynasty 21 and early Dynasty 22. The pharaohs of this time were no longer buried in the Valley of the Kings, but instead built tombs in the Delta, far to the north, where they resided. Security was lax in the Theban necropolis. The coffins and funerary goods of the wealthy citizens of Thebes were placed in unmarked and undecorated family tombs cut into the cliffs on the west bank of the Nile. All the care and detail that in more prosperous times were devoted to the decoration of the tomb chapel were now lavished on the elaborately painted coffins. Every available surface is crowded with religious scenes, images of funerary gods and goddesses, protective spells, and magical symbols. The deceased appears mummiform. An elaborate floral collar entirely covers the upper body, exposing only the separately attached hands (now lost). A pair of red \"mummy braces\" are crossed over the chest, their point of intersection marked by a winged sun disk. The lower body is covered with tiny figures modeled in gesso against a yellow background, which gives the effect of gold inlaid with glass or semiprecious stone. The decoration on the interior features two deified dead kings of Dynasty 18. Although these rulers had lived centuries before, memory of their greatness was still very much alive. The main scene near the top depicts Tuthmosis III, the great military pharaoh, who lived 500 years before Bakenmut. Posed as a mummy, the ruler wears a brilliant feathered garment enfolding him with falcon’s wings. The scene below features back-to-back seated images of Amenhotep I, regarded as the patron of the Theban cemetery and worshiped as a local god there.",

On the surface of the canvas, two elements come together, interact with each other, and affect each other’s appearance. The arrangement of the two colors red and blue, which work to intensify one another, is one essential component of the work. The other is the confrontation of two different forms: The edges of one shape-the blue rectangle-are given by the edges of the canvas and are therefore logical and measurable, while the organic form of the red color field, despite the clean, precise rendering, seems to breathe and float, activating the composition as a whole. In this way, even though there is no trace of the artist’s hand, the painting refers to very natural and organic forms and ways of perception.",

          "biography": "A leader of the symbolist movement in France, Odilon Redon was born in Bordeaux in 1840 and grew up in the surrounding region. During his early years he studied drawing, architecture, and the violin. A friendship with Armand Clavaud, a local botanist and philosopher, stimulated Redon's passion for romantic art and literature. In 1864, after a brief and discouraging period of instruction with Gérôme in Paris, Redon returned to Bordeaux, where he studied printmaking with Rodolphe Bresdin (1825-1885). Deploring the emphasis on rational, phenomenal experience in academic and naturalist art, Redon turned for inspiration to the imaginative paintings of Delacroix, the prints of Francisco José de Goya (1746-1828), and the poetry of Charles Baudelaire. In 1870, after military service in the Franco-Prussian War, Redon settled in Paris and produced his first <em>Noirs</em>. These visionary images, featuring floating eyes and severed heads born aloft on wings, reflect Redon's belief in the superiority of the imagination and fantasy, which he considered \"the messenger of the unconscious.\" After producing his initial <em>Noirs </em>in charcoal, Redon discovered a method of transferring his drawings to lithography in 1876. Throughout the 1880s he continued to use charcoal, etching, and lithography as his primary media, and he produced twelve lithography albums before abandoning the genre in the late 1890s. During the 1880s Redon emerged as a leader of the symbolist reaction against impressionism. The publication in 1879 of his first lithographic album, <em>Dans le rêve</em>, followed by his first solo exhibition in 1881, attracted the admiration of J. K. Huysmans, who included illustrations by Redon in his novel <em>À rebours</em> (1884). Around the same time, Redon developed a personal and artistic relationship with poet Stéphane Mallarmé. Increasingly drawn into the public arena, Redon helped organize the Société des Artistes Indépendants in 1884. In 1886 he participated in the last impressionist exhibition and began showing with Les XX in Brussels. Redon's antinaturalist, visionary, art inspired many symbolist and Nabi artists, including Gauguin and Vuillard. Maurice Denis praised Redon as \"our Mallarmé,\" and in 1892 critic Albert Aurier described Redon as a leader of the new \"idealistic\" tendency in art. After 1890 the focus of Redon's activity shifted from monochromatic drawings and prints toward exploring color in richly worked pastels. His innovations in luminous color, as seen in the pastel and oil paintings he exhibited at the Galeries Durand-Ruel in 1900 were greatly admired by Henri Matisse (1869-1954) and the Fauves. Awarded the Legion of Honor in 1903, Redon continued his leadership role in the avant-garde and in 1904 became a founding member of the Salon d'Automne. In 1913 forty of his works were selected for exhibition in the Armory Show, the most by any artist. Redon died at his home in Paris in the summer of 1916.",

In 1939, Hanna loaned the pastel to the New York World’s Fair, where it represented Redon’s work. Those who saw it there were attracted to the vivid color and timeless subject, which preoccupied the artist at the end of his life.",

It is unique among other excavated drum stands of the Chu, which typically show two birds standing on tigers. The theme of the bird stepping on the serpent was common in the Chu visual culture. Yet the slender proportions and seemingly flimsy structure of this particular set raise the question of whether it was utilitarian or mostly served symbolic functions in the tomb. <br><br>The birds' and serpents' bodies have designs painted in red lacquer and yellow pigment against the black lacquer. Scientific analyses confirm the additional use of a blue or green pigment that has been discolored over time.",

The Christ child’s attention seems drawn to something outside the picture and lifts his hand in recognition. The opposing panel, once hinged on the right, would have featured a portrait of its original owner in prayer, now unfortunately lost. Such devotional portrait diptychs were popular after 1400 and remained so until their production ceased around the 1530s. Used in private chapels or within the curtain folds of four-poster beds, they could easily be closed when not in use. Hans Memling was born near Frankfurt, Germany. He settled in Bruges around 1465 where he developed a reputation for his painting skills, and provided works to the Burgundian court, which likely cultivated the taste for small portrait diptychs. This example seems to have been painted by a member of Memling’s workshop, perhaps for a wealthy merchant or clergyman.",

Until 1881, the firm manufactured primarily jewelry for Saint Petersburg's aristocrats and wealthy elite. In 1885 the firm was awarded the coveted imperial warrant as goldsmith to the tsar and began to produce elaborate presentation Easter eggs as a gift for the tsarina from her husband every year. They also produced luxurious accessories, jewelry, and hardstone sculptures. At one point, Faberge employed over 300 workers including 22 workmasters who oversaw the production of the firm's jewelry and precious objects. A branch of the firm opened in Moscow in 1887, specializing in neo-Russian and pan-Slavic motifs in jewelry, silver, and enamel. Other branches followed in Kiev, London, and Odessa as well as new premises in Saint Petersburg. At the onset of the Russian Revolution, Peter Carl Faberge fled the country to Paris then Switzerland, where he died in 1920. His firm was nationalized by the Bolsheviks in 1918.",

          "biography": "A leader of the symbolist movement in France, Odilon Redon was born in Bordeaux in 1840 and grew up in the surrounding region. During his early years he studied drawing, architecture, and the violin. A friendship with Armand Clavaud, a local botanist and philosopher, stimulated Redon's passion for romantic art and literature. In 1864, after a brief and discouraging period of instruction with Gérôme in Paris, Redon returned to Bordeaux, where he studied printmaking with Rodolphe Bresdin (1825-1885). Deploring the emphasis on rational, phenomenal experience in academic and naturalist art, Redon turned for inspiration to the imaginative paintings of Delacroix, the prints of Francisco José de Goya (1746-1828), and the poetry of Charles Baudelaire. In 1870, after military service in the Franco-Prussian War, Redon settled in Paris and produced his first <em>Noirs</em>. These visionary images, featuring floating eyes and severed heads born aloft on wings, reflect Redon's belief in the superiority of the imagination and fantasy, which he considered \"the messenger of the unconscious.\" After producing his initial <em>Noirs </em>in charcoal, Redon discovered a method of transferring his drawings to lithography in 1876. Throughout the 1880s he continued to use charcoal, etching, and lithography as his primary media, and he produced twelve lithography albums before abandoning the genre in the late 1890s. During the 1880s Redon emerged as a leader of the symbolist reaction against impressionism. The publication in 1879 of his first lithographic album, <em>Dans le rêve</em>, followed by his first solo exhibition in 1881, attracted the admiration of J. K. Huysmans, who included illustrations by Redon in his novel <em>À rebours</em> (1884). Around the same time, Redon developed a personal and artistic relationship with poet Stéphane Mallarmé. Increasingly drawn into the public arena, Redon helped organize the Société des Artistes Indépendants in 1884. In 1886 he participated in the last impressionist exhibition and began showing with Les XX in Brussels. Redon's antinaturalist, visionary, art inspired many symbolist and Nabi artists, including Gauguin and Vuillard. Maurice Denis praised Redon as \"our Mallarmé,\" and in 1892 critic Albert Aurier described Redon as a leader of the new \"idealistic\" tendency in art. After 1890 the focus of Redon's activity shifted from monochromatic drawings and prints toward exploring color in richly worked pastels. His innovations in luminous color, as seen in the pastel and oil paintings he exhibited at the Galeries Durand-Ruel in 1900 were greatly admired by Henri Matisse (1869-1954) and the Fauves. Awarded the Legion of Honor in 1903, Redon continued his leadership role in the avant-garde and in 1904 became a founding member of the Salon d'Automne. In 1913 forty of his works were selected for exhibition in the Armory Show, the most by any artist. Redon died at his home in Paris in the summer of 1916.",

Part of the Print Club of Cleveland’s early gift of lithographs by Redon to the museum, this impression is a unique trial proof, printed while the artist was collaborating with master printer Becquet to assess the composition’s progress.",

Like Henri Matisse, Braque advanced the Fauve aim of liberating color from natural appearances in order to use it for purely expressive purposes. <em>Port of L’Estaque </em>is filled with bold strokes of pure, unmodulated color, often in juxtapositions of complementary color contrasts: orange against blue, green against red, yellow against violet. The explosive palette and radical simplifications of form are intended to produce an intense sensory experience that conveys the artist’s emotional response to the motif.",
      "wall_description": "Widely celebrated as the co-inventor of Cubism, Georges Braque was also one of the leading artists of the Fauve movement. He spent the fall of 1906 painting at the Mediterranean port town of L’Estaque near Marseilles, a time he later described as a turning point in his art: \"I was freed from the studios, only twenty-four, and full of enthusiasm. I moved toward what for me represented novelty and joy, toward Fauvism. It was in the south of France that I first felt truly elated. Just think, I had only recently left the dark, dismal Paris studios where they still painted with pitch! What a joyful revelation I had there!\" Deriving inspiration from the art of Paul Cézanne and Henri Matisse, Braque filled this dynamic composition with energetic brushwork and pure color, completely liberated from natural appearances. The Centre Pompidou in Paris owns a smaller version of the same subject. This painting is one of the most important of Braque’s Fauve period.",

Orestes has killed them both to avenge their murder of his father Agamemnon, upon his return from years of fighting at Troy. At the far left, three Furies (avenging spirits) rest upon Agamemnon's tomb, while at the far right, Orestes atones for the murders at the Delphian shrine of Apollo, marked by a tripod and rock. On the lid, four reclining women symbolize the seasons, arranged in right-to-left order: Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn, as indicated by their dress and the contents of their baskets.",
      "wall_description": "The front of this sarcophagus, or coffin, is decorated with a series of scenes about the mythical Greek hero Orestes, shown three times wielding a short sword. In the center he stands over the body of his mother Clytemnestra, and at the left over the body of her lover Aegisthus. Orestes has murdered both of them to avenge the death of his father Agamemnon, king of the Greeks, who had left home many years earlier to fight in the Trojan War. Upon returning to his kingdom, he found his unfaithful wife with her lover Aegisthus. These two then killed Agamemnon, and Orestes vowed that when he became a man he would seek revenge. At the far left is Agamemnon's tomb with Greek Furies (avenging spirits) resting on it. At the far right, Orestes visits the shrine of Apollo at Delphi (marked by the tripod and rock) to atone for the murders. The front of the lid is decorated with four reclining women who symbolize the seasons. From left to right they are: Autumn, Summer, Spring, and Winter. On the short sides are winged, bearded griffins (half-lion and half-eagle). The sarcophagus was probably made for an upper-class tomb outside Rome.",

Given its small size, its original function was for private devotional use. It could be folded like a book when not in use and was highly portable. The missing panel has not been positively identified but probably represented another biblical scene like the Crucifixion. The painting’s refined and ornate style reflects the courtly aesthetic that appealed to royal and aristocratic patrons in the decades around 1400. On the panel’s richly tooled reverse (not visible) are the arms of the house of Hainault quartered with those of Bavaria. While this coat of arms is certainly that of the work’s patron, probably a member of the united dynasties of Hainault and Bavaria, their identity remains elusive.",

It was purchased by Mrs. L. E. Holden before the museum’s acquisition of the two flanking panels of Saint Anthony Abbot and Saint Michael. It has been suggested that this painting is a copy of the original lost central panel of Fra Filippo’s triptych of 1457.",

      "wall_description": "This sculpture, along with that of Saint Stephen (1959.43), and two female saints preserved in Frankfurt (Historisches Museum), are believed to be the remaining fragments of a large altarpiece carved by Riemenschneider for the Dominican convent in Rothenburg in Franconia (demolished in 1813). Saints Stephen and Lawrence both wear the dalmatic to indicate their status as deacons in the early church. Each holds a symbol of his martyrdom; here, Saint Lawrence holds a grill to indicate his death by burning. Late Gothic Style Art in Germany through the early 1500s remained firmly anchored in the late Gothic style with its associated interests in realism. Riemenschneider was one of the most prolific and versatile sculptors of this style, a recognized master in both stone and wood. His flourishing workshop employed as many as 40 apprentices in sculpting, woodcarving, and painting. His sculptures are noted for the dreamy, melancholy, and introspective quality in their expressions, as well as their remarkable attention to detail.",

In 1885 the firm was awarded the coveted imperial warrant as goldsmith to the tsar and began to produce elaborate presentation Easter eggs as a gift for the tsarina from her husband every year. They also produced luxurious accessories, jewelry, and hardstone sculptures. At one point, Faberge employed over 300 workers including 22 workmasters who oversaw the production of the firm's jewelry and precious objects. A branch of the firm opened in Moscow in 1887, specializing in neo-Russian and pan-Slavic motifs in jewelry, silver, and enamel. Other branches followed in Kiev, London, and Odessa as well as new premises in Saint Petersburg. At the onset of the Russian Revolution, Peter Carl Faberge fled the country to Paris then Switzerland, where he died in 1920. His firm was nationalized by the Bolsheviks in 1918.",

The icon signifies Christ’s incarnation, suffering, and death for the sake of humankind. Three ornamental stars on the Virgin’s cloak are traditional symbols of her chastity; a blue cap covers her hair and protects her modesty. The child wears a pale green tunic and deep orange cloak, both highlighted in gold. The Christ Child holds a scroll tied with a ribbon, a symbol of the Gospels. The icon was painted by the Cretan icon painter Akotantos, the preeminent artistic personality on Crete during the 1400s. This icon is from his period of greatest activity and pre-dates the collapse of Constantinople in 1453. The treatment of the faces and draperies is handled with fluency and skill and reveals Akotantos to be a painter of great talent. Given its large scale, the icon was intended for use within an orthodox church, possibly a monastery, and not for a private home.",

          "biography": "Claude Monet spent his youth in Le Havre in Normandy, where his father worked as a wholesale grocer. By the age of sixteen, he had exhibited some of his caricatures in an art supply store, leading to his acquaintance with Boudin (q.v.). It was Boudin who first encouraged him to paint out of doors. In 1859 Monet traveled to Paris, where he saw Boudin's salon debut and met Constant Troyon (1810-1865). A year later he joined the Académie Suisse, where he was introduced to Pissarro (q.v.), but his studies were interrupted in 1861 when he was drafted for a seven-year stint in the military. His family would pay for his release from military duties only if he gave up painting. Finding this unacceptable, Monet served for one year in Algeria before an early return to France to convalesce after a severe illness. In 1862 he met Jongkind (q.v.), another important influence on the young painter's development. Monet's father then allowed him to pursue his art career in Paris, where he entered the studio of the Swiss painter Charles Gleyre (1806-1874). He studied with Gleyre until 1864 and befriended Frédéric Bazille (1841-1870), Renoir (q.v.), and Sisley (q.v.), with whom he painted in the forest of Fontainebleau (Déjeuner sur l'herbe, 1865, two fragments in Musée d'Orsay, Paris). Monet first exhibited at the Salon of 1865 and would do so again in 1866, 1868, and 1880. In 1868 he shared a studio with Bazille and Renoir but was soon forced to leave Paris to escape his creditors. He took his mistress, Camille Doncieux, and their son, Jean, to Fécamp, then Étretat, and finally Saint-Michel. There Renoir provided hospitality, and the two also painted at the boating and bathing center of La Grenouillère on the Seine. In 1870 Monet married Camille and, to escape the Franco-Prussian War, left for London, where he remained for nine months and met Durand-Ruel, his first dealer. In the summer of 1871 he visited the Netherlands and then settled in Argenteuil, to the west of Paris. He converted a boat into a studio, as Daubigny (q.v.) had done before him, allowing him to explore different viewpoints for his landscapes. He assisted in the organization of the First Impressionist Exhibition in 1874, partly because Durand-Ruel's worsened business situation had prevented the dealer from buying his art. The following year he participated in the Hôtel Drouot sale with Morisot (q.v.), Renoir, and Sisley. In 1878 Monet and his wife moved to Vétheuil with the Hoschedés, who had previously commissioned some works. Camille died the following year, and, while Ernest Hoschedé spent most of his time in Paris trying to settle his precarious financial situation, Monet stayed behind with Ernest's wife, Alice. In 1881 he moved with her and her children to Poissy and within two years was living at Giverny, where he would remain for the rest of his life. He painted some of his famous scenes-the haystack and poplar series, for example- in 1890-91. Ernest Hoschedé died in 1891, and Monet married Alice the following year. At Giverny, Monet explored the themes of his garden and water lilies. He continued to travel, going to Norway in 1895, making three trips to London from 1899 through 1901, and taking Alice to Venice in 1908. The final years of his life were mainly spent working on his Great Decorations, large paintings of a water lily pond designed for two oval rooms at the Paris Orangerie. Monet is generally considered the most typical exponent of impressionism.",

          "biography": "A leading exponent of French neoclassicism and the academic tradition, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres was born in Montauban in 1780. At the age of ten he began studying art and music in Toulouse. In 1797 he entered the Paris studio of David (q.v.), where he became a favorite pupil and assistant. Barely a year later a dispute prompted Ingres to leave the studio and enroll in the École des Beaux-Arts. In 1801 he won the Prix de Rome, but lack of funds prevented him from departing for Italy until 1806. During fourteen years in Rome and four in Florence, Ingres painted romantic troubadour themes and became an admirer of Raphael. In 1824 he returned to Paris and exhibited at the Salon, where a fierce debate erupted between his supporters and those of Delacroix (q.v.). The controversial Salon of 1824 signaled Ingres's emergence as the leader of the neoclassical movement in France. At that point he effectively assumed the role of his former teacher David, now in exile. In 1833 the French government appointed Ingres vice president of the École des Beaux-Arts and president the following year. In 1834 he accepted the directorship of the French Academy in Rome and spent the next seven years painting and studying antique art in Italy. In 1841 he returned to Paris, where his paintings were greeted with thunderous critical acclaim. A major retrospective at the Exposition Universelle of 1855 confirmed his reputation but also aroused the hostility of young artists opposed to academic rules and conventions. During his later years Ingres continued his bitter rivalry with Delacroix, successfully blocking the latter's admission to the academy until 1857. Ingres died in 1867, leaving behind a circle of followers and a remarkable drawing style that was to inspire later artists, including Degas (q.v.) and Pablo Picasso (1881-1973).",

      "digital_description": "Carved from a single piece of ivory for Prince Karl Eusebius von Liechtenstein of Vienna, this work is a true tour-de-force. It took Lenckhardt seven years to complete; it is his last known sculpture and the pinnacle of his career. The biblical accounts of the descent from the cross found in the gospels are not consistent, which may contribute to the difficulty in precisely identifying the figures. The Virgin Mary, Saint John, Mary Magdalene, and others were said to be present, but undoubtedly there are other disciples here mourning Christ’s death. The intense emotion registers on the faces of the figures in the scrupulous and exquisitely detailed work.",
      "wall_description": "The prince of Liechtenstein, Karl Eusebius--one of the preeminent Central European art collectors and patrons of music during the 1600s--commissioned this work. The contract challenged Lenckhardt to carve an eight-figure group out of a single huge African elephant tusk from Eusebius’s own treasury. Because of the tusk’s hollow interior, the artist plugged the sculpture with an additional piece of ivory at the base, now the skull and bone at the foot of the cross. The story unfolds only by walking around the sculpture, with every viewpoint offering subtle fluctuations of the narrative.",

          "biography": "A leader of the symbolist movement in France, Odilon Redon was born in Bordeaux in 1840 and grew up in the surrounding region. During his early years he studied drawing, architecture, and the violin. A friendship with Armand Clavaud, a local botanist and philosopher, stimulated Redon's passion for romantic art and literature. In 1864, after a brief and discouraging period of instruction with Gérôme in Paris, Redon returned to Bordeaux, where he studied printmaking with Rodolphe Bresdin (1825-1885). Deploring the emphasis on rational, phenomenal experience in academic and naturalist art, Redon turned for inspiration to the imaginative paintings of Delacroix, the prints of Francisco José de Goya (1746-1828), and the poetry of Charles Baudelaire. In 1870, after military service in the Franco-Prussian War, Redon settled in Paris and produced his first <em>Noirs</em>. These visionary images, featuring floating eyes and severed heads born aloft on wings, reflect Redon's belief in the superiority of the imagination and fantasy, which he considered \"the messenger of the unconscious.\" After producing his initial <em>Noirs </em>in charcoal, Redon discovered a method of transferring his drawings to lithography in 1876. Throughout the 1880s he continued to use charcoal, etching, and lithography as his primary media, and he produced twelve lithography albums before abandoning the genre in the late 1890s. During the 1880s Redon emerged as a leader of the symbolist reaction against impressionism. The publication in 1879 of his first lithographic album, <em>Dans le rêve</em>, followed by his first solo exhibition in 1881, attracted the admiration of J. K. Huysmans, who included illustrations by Redon in his novel <em>À rebours</em> (1884). Around the same time, Redon developed a personal and artistic relationship with poet Stéphane Mallarmé. Increasingly drawn into the public arena, Redon helped organize the Société des Artistes Indépendants in 1884. In 1886 he participated in the last impressionist exhibition and began showing with Les XX in Brussels. Redon's antinaturalist, visionary, art inspired many symbolist and Nabi artists, including Gauguin and Vuillard. Maurice Denis praised Redon as \"our Mallarmé,\" and in 1892 critic Albert Aurier described Redon as a leader of the new \"idealistic\" tendency in art. After 1890 the focus of Redon's activity shifted from monochromatic drawings and prints toward exploring color in richly worked pastels. His innovations in luminous color, as seen in the pastel and oil paintings he exhibited at the Galeries Durand-Ruel in 1900 were greatly admired by Henri Matisse (1869-1954) and the Fauves. Awarded the Legion of Honor in 1903, Redon continued his leadership role in the avant-garde and in 1904 became a founding member of the Salon d'Automne. In 1913 forty of his works were selected for exhibition in the Armory Show, the most by any artist. Redon died at his home in Paris in the summer of 1916.",

            "Burchard and Raphael Rosenberg first began corresponding about the Rubens in March 1945, and it seems that Rosenberg and Stiebel made the decision to purchase the painting that month. Saemy Rosenberg mentions a letter of March 27, 1945 in which Raphael Rosenberg writes that Burchard’s “favorable opinion” of the Rubens “encouraged [them] to buy the painting.” Several photographs in the Rubenianum’s file on the painting are marked with annotations stating that the painting was with Rosenberg and Stiebel beginning in November 1945, the month in which the purchase must have taken place. Pinakos, Inc., owned by Rudolf Heinemann, often partnered with Rosenberg and Stiebel in the purchase of paintings. Each firm owned a half-share in the Rubens painting, but because Pinakos is not mentioned in the above correspondence, Rosenberg and Stiebel may have sold the half-share following their initial purchase of the painting in November 1945. In the fall of 1946, CMA director William Milliken and curator Henry Sayles Francis saw the painting at Rosenberg and Stiebel in New York, but at the time, the museum was not in a position to purchase it. In April 1947, Francis writes to Saemy Rosenberg to say that the museum would like to consider the painting, if it was still available, for the collection."

            "It is unclear which Kappel heirs inherited the Rubens and ultimately sold it to Rosenberg and Stiebel, whose files apparently do not name the seller of the painting. In a letter to Raphael Rosenberg dated May 28th, 1946, Ludwig Burchard simply states: “after Marcus Kappel’s death, the picture remained in the possession of the family.”  A notation on the back of photograph of the Rubens in the files of the Rubenianum reads, “Nov. 1945 in America den Kappel-Erben abgekauft von Rosenberg &amp; Stiebel, New York.” The heir(s) may have been Ellen Rathenau-Ettlinger and/or Ernst Rathenau, Kappel’s grandchildren, who inherited a number of works from their grandfather’s collection. While there is no definitive confirmation that they were in possession of the painting throughout the war, there is also no indication that they were not, and no documentation suggests that the painting was seized by the Nazis."

            "An annotation in the Rubenianum's copy of this sale catalogue indicates that the painting was withdrawn because it failed to meet its reserve price: \"Limite R[eichs] M[ark] 150.000\". Rubens scholar Ludwig Burchard wrote on the back of one of the Rubenianum's file photographs of the Rubens, “Photo Erhalten 27. Febr. 1930 durch Caspari, München.” The role Galerie Caspari played, if any, in the painting’s provenance is unclear. The gallery may have merely supplied the photograph. However, Caspari and Cassirer do appear adjacent to one another in the provenances of several other paintings, and so some transaction involving the painting may have taken place; perhaps the Kappel heirs first consigned the painting to Galerie Caspari, and after it failed to sell, it was consigned to Cassirer/Helbing for sale at auction."

In 1841 Bouguereau's father, a wine merchant, moved the family to Bordeaux. The following year he was allowed to attend the École Municipale de Dessin et de Peinture, where he studied under Jean-Paul Alaux. Bouguereau became a bookkeeper for another wine merchant in order to meet the cost of the school. By 1844 he had won the first prize for figure painting, which further encouraged him to pursue his art career. He lived with his uncle in Mortagne from 1845 until 1846, painted portraits of the local landowners, and saved enough money to move to Paris. In 1846 he entered the École des Beaux-Arts and studied under François-Édouard Picot (1786-1868). After several attempts, he finally won the Premier Grand Prix de Rome in 1850. He lived at the Villa Medici in Rome and studied Raphael, Andrea del Sarto, Giotto's Paduan frescos, and those at San Francesco in Assisi. The impact of these works appeared in Bouguereau's oeuvre in the form of classical poses, restraint, and a high degree of finish. After his return to France, Bouguereau exhibited regularly at the Salon, concentrating on classical, genre, and religious themes. In 1858 he was commissioned to decorate his first public building-the Chapel of St. Louis in St. Clotilde Church in Paris. Other public commissions followed, including the chapels of St. Pierre-Paul and St. Jean-Baptiste at St. Augustin Church in Paris, the cupola decorations in the cathedral in La Rochelle, and the ceiling of the Grand Theater of Bordeaux. Bouguereau remained in France during the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71), fighting in the National Guard. Afterward he taught at the Académie Julian in Paris. In 1876 he fulfilled a lifelong goal, being elected to the Académie des Beaux-Arts de l'Institut de France. He received the Legion of Honor in 1878 and was a professor at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1888. Bouguereau's support of the academy and his interest in classicism caused a fall in his popularity at the end of his life. Nevertheless, he died a successful, wealthy artist.",
